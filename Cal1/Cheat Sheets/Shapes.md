1. Circle: The equation for a circle with center $(h,k)$ and radius $r$ is:

    $$(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$$

2. Parabola: The equation for a parabola that opens upwards or downwards with vertex $(h,k)$ is:

    $$y = a(x-h)^2 + k$$

   where $a$ is a constant that determines the width of the parabola.

3. Ellipse: The equation for an ellipse centered at $(h,k)$ with semi-major axis $a$ and semi-minor axis $b$ is:

    $$\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} + \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$$

4. Hyperbola: The equation for a hyperbola centered at $(h,k)$ with transverse axis $2a$ and conjugate axis $2b$ is:

    $$\frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} - \frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} = 1$$

   or

    $$\frac{(y-k)^2}{b^2} - \frac{(x-h)^2}{a^2} = 1$$

5. Triangle: The coordinates of the vertices of a triangle can be used to find the equation of its sides using the slope-intercept form:

    $$y = mx + b$$

   where $m$ is the slope of the line and $b$ is the y-intercept. The equation of a side of a triangle can be found by using the coordinates of two of its vertices.
