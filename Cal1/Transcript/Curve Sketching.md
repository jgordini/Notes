Section 3.6: Curve Sketching

So let's talk about section 3.6, curve sketch. This is basically using intercepts, like x and y intercepts. Your relative, max relative, min, which are your relative, extreme, and your concavity to sketch a curve, you graph it to see a really good approximation of what it looks like without a graphic calculator.

Finding Intercepts
 Now yes, your graphic calculator will do it for you, but to understand why these graphs are shaped the way that they are, you need the calculator, so you really understand why they are the way that they are. So do an example? Let's take a look at what I'll do. I'll give you an example, and I'll give you the steps as we go through that. Would that help you?

Step one, when you're graphing any curve, is, well, you want to find out as many intercepts as you can. X intercepts and y intercepts. That's always a good thing to do, right? Because in most cases that gives you at least an approximation of what you're talking about, where you're crossing y axis for your crossing x axis.

X and Y Intercepts
 So step number one, every time. You're going to find the intercepts. All intercepts? By the way, how do you find x intercepts? How do you find x intercepts? Say it. y equals zero. So set the equation equal to zero. Let's say you find x intercepts. You set equal zero. You solve for x. That's going to give you any roots. That's what a root was, right? When you set the function equal to zero and you solve for x, you find out where it's crossing the x axis.

Y intercepts are quite a bit easier. By the way, you only do this step that's easy. Easy, easy means it's quadratic or lower, or it's already factored for you. So cubics, don't spend your time factoring them. If I give them a T on a test, I'll just give you the x intercepts.

Rational Functions 
Step number two applies only to rational functions. It does not apply to polynomials because polynomials do not have this. For rational functions, a lot of times with rational functions, you're going to get some asymptotes. You're going to get some holes.

Finding Asymptotes and Holes 
So for rational polynomials, they don't have those. It's continuous everywhere. You don't have asymptotes, you don't have holes. So this is why it's only for rational functions. You're going to find all the asymptotes. Vertical and horizontal and any holes. How do you find horizontal asymptotes?

The First Derivative Test 
Step number three is you finally get to do some calculus. You're going to do the first derivative test. Remember the first derivative test? You had a whole homework section on that, right? First derivative test, you said equal to zero. It will give you two things. Critical numbers and increase and increase.

The Second Derivative Test 
After you do the first derivative test, what do you think you're going to do next? Geniuses. The second derivative test. What does the second derivative test give you? Yep, the reason why you do it, just like Scott said, you can do vertical on cavity and for inflection points.

Making a Table 
Step number five, remember the table head you make that has the first derivative on top. The second derivative on the bottom, it tells you increase and decrease and increase and all that stuff and it tells you about cavity. So basically it gives you a picture of your graph right there. That's what you make.

Completing the Curve Sketch At this point, you're going to have everything you need. You're going to have your intercepts. That's huge. You're going to have any asymptotes. You put those on your graph. You're going to have any holes. You put those on your graph. You'll have your critical numbers and your inflection points.

Finding Points What you won't have is the actual points. You'll have critical numbers, plug them in. Find all possible points. Those are those domains and inflection. Find your points from the original function. The last, if you get the points and all the areas and increase and decrease and decrease in cavity.

Example Problem Okay, we're going to get at least the first two tests done on this thing. We have the intercepts. We've got x and y. We don't need to do step number two because they're not rational. We're going to do the first derivative test.

Simplifying Calculations Don't fool yourself here. Yes, that looks pretty nasty. You say, oh, my gosh. That's a product rule with a chain rule or a general power rule in it. That could get pretty hairy and that's a city equal to zero. Or maybe be a little bit smarter about that.

Distributing Probably easier to distribute that. Maybe distribute some of those easier ones first that we don't have to do all those rules. Now, if it was to the sixth power or something, firstly, that'd be insane. But secondly, you wouldn't want to do that. Just go ahead and maybe distribute that.

Next Steps So, why don't you try that right now? Okay, so we got through the first derivative test. We didn't do the second derivative test. We didn't do step number two. So we have one more test to do, which is the second derivative test. But that's the basic idea.

Time Consuming Process You know, they're very long problems. Especially with rational, they take a long time. They're not easy. Well, it's actually not hard. They're very time-consuming. So they're going to take a long time. That can lie.

text = "that. Did you get that?  Okay, keep working.  Step number one, we got step number two. We don't need it. Step number three.  Firstly, were you able to get that? That's a heavy word. You're able to get that.  Take the first derivative and do the first derivative test. Go for it.  By the way, that whole lot easier to take the derivative of than that, right?  Try that on some of those graphing ones. That's usually going to be something doable for you, at least doable.  So, try some of that. So, take the first derivative. Let's do that together.  Everybody, what is the first derivative when I do that?  What was that? What do I do for a first derivative test?  If I set that equal to zero, I'm going to get x equals, I'll show the work on that if you really want me to.  This will be 3x squared equals 3. x squared equals 1. x equals plus or minus the square root of 1.  x equals 1 and negative 1. You're okay with that so far? Okay.  Hey, that's the first derivative test. That's not too bad. Let's do step number four.  Step number four is, can you do the second derivative test?  Second derivative test says, well, take the second derivative. Go ahead and do that now. Take the second derivative.  How much is the second derivative? Oh, that's beautiful. I love that.  What do you do with that 6x? When you solve for zero, what are you finding here?  You're trying to find possible inflection points. So, when you divide by 6, x equals zero.  These right here are your critical numbers. This right here is a possible inflection point.  Let's recap for just a second before I start making the table for you, and then we'll do the table next time."

"How many people feel okay on finding x and the y intercept? That's our basic algebra.  Do you feel okay with our first derivative test and our second derivative test?  Where should you have the lower order of that? Now, step number five. This is where all your work happens.  All your work happens right here in step five.  You're going to have what you got from your first derivative. You're going to have what you got from your second derivative.  And you're going to put it all a bit on something that looks almost like a graph. It's a number line.  What were our critical numbers that we needed?  So, negative one. Positive one. Zero goes on the bottom. Why does zero go on the bottom?  Okay, so critical numbers, critical numbers went on the top. That was our first derivative.  That's what we got right. Possible inflection points. That's from our second derivative that goes on the bottom of our table.  It has to be ordered, negative one, zero, one. Do you feel okay with that so far?"

"What do you do now? So every single interval here, you follow? What number are you going to check here?  And where are you going to check it? In the first derivative. What are you going to check here?  What was that? Negative one, right? Does it matter? Negative one,

"You're going to check it in the second derivative. Okay, why don't you go ahead and do that? Fill that table out for next time because that's where I'm going to start next time. If you want to hang out for a second, I'll do it right now. Okay? For this one, if I plug in f prime of negative two, if I plug in f prime of zero, I can do that. And that's prime of one. I'm doing my first derivative. I'm going to get positive. I'm going to get negative, and I'm going to get positive. That means increasing, decreasing, increasing. You follow me on that? Yes or no? Yeah. Okay. Second derivative, I try f double prime of negative one. I try f double prime of positive one. Remember, it's just this interval. It doesn't mean you can't plug those in for your second derivative. That's okay. Negative one gives you negative. Concave down. Positive one gives you six. That's positive. Concave up. Show it how something will feel okay with our concave down, concave up. That right there is a picture of our graph. We're done with step five. This basically tells you up, down, up. We just have to find some points, and we'll graph that next time."

"Let's finish that problem. We're dealing with basically just a polynomial. We know that we can take a first derivative pretty easily. If we distribute and we've already done that, we've found first derivative test, second derivative test. We have our intervals of increasing, decreasing, intervals of concave. Concave up and down. We also have our relative. Which one is this? Max or min? relative, max, relative, and... Good. Question point. We don't have as actual points, right? We need the points now. So, the steps that we haven't done, after you've done your first and second derivative test, you've made me the table. What I want to see is your points. Now, I know the x-intercepts automatically give us some points. Basically, one zero. Negative two zero. Those are my x-intercepts. My y-intercept will give me another one. Zero two. So, x-intercept, y-intercept. But then all of my critical numbers, my critical points, my relative, max, and min, that's more points. My inflection point. That's another point. So, you need to also give me the y-ok on the one zero and the negative two zero. It's my x-intercepts. My y-intercept is at zero two. That's what we got this from. We did that last time, right? You know, remember that? Look back at the nodes. We're looking at video. We did that last time. Now, those are x-intercepts, y-intercepts. We also have relative, max. We have relative, min, and we're going to have an inflection point. Just one in this case. Can you please tell me what's the x-coordinate for my relative, max? The x-coordinate for my relative, max. What? That you don't want to be the x-coordinate for the relative, max. You follow it? Zero. How'd you get the zero? Plug the original, the original. Good. The original one is what gives you points. So, to find our


Header: Finding Points for the Graph (Continued)

"The original one is what gives you points. So, to find our points out, you take the negative one, plug it back up into here, or this one would probably be a little bit easier. And that will give you out the y-value. You follow me? That gives you your points. So, this is going to be negative one. Let's see. Negative one. Plus three. Two. Two. Is that? I think so. Can you tell me? Plug it into this four. Over. This happens, right? It's all good. What's the little point between friends, huh? A move point. Right. Okay. Negative one. Plus three. Plus two. Four. Find your relative min. What's the x-value for your relative min, please? What is that? So, I'm going to put a one here. How do I find the y-value? Look at this. That one's going to be... That one's zero. In flexion point, can you please tell me about x-coordinate for my inflection point? Zero. Zero comma. That's the answer to your point in there. Not only is it the y-intercept, it's also the inflection point. So, we have that point twice, not a big deal. You feel okay with the points? Here's how to label them on your graph. What's your excuse to work your way down, just like we did in the process? Start with your x-intercepts. One zero. Put a point. Negative two zero. Put a point. Those are my x-intercepts. My y-intercept is zero two. Put a point. Relative max happens at negative one four. Put a point. Relative min happens at one zero. Put a point. That's already there. Now, here's how I like to label these points. When you have the inflection point, you need to label it inflection point. That way you see the change in concavity. So, which one of these inflection points was the zero two one? So, I'm going to label that inflection point, just IP, just so you know it's IP. For your relative extremo, your relative max in relative min, what I like to do, I like to draw a little dotted line. So, for my relative max, which is at one, negative one four, I like to do that. That says, I can't go above that. For this one, this one zero, that I know that was a relative min, right? I'm going to do this. I can't go below that. I know that my graph is going to bounce off of those dashed lines. Do you follow me on that? That's what's going to happen here. It's going to, well, follow in our graph. Go up, bounce off, hit an inflection point, bounce off, and then keep going forever. Does that make sense to you? So, label those things with something like that. Do you think inflection point changes concavity? Do your relative max relative min? Do little dashed lines that way you know you're not going to go past that, you're going to be changing those values."

"Let's see if we can graph our graph. If we follow this table and associate them with these points, we should have a pretty good looking graph. It says you're going to start out, you're going to be increasing. Which way is increasing? This way or this way? So, we're increasing. How are we increasing? Concave down. So, increasing concave down. Increasing. This is concave up. This is concave down. You follow? We're increasing concave down. It says increasing
