Introduction to Chapter Four

In chapter four, the focus shifts from derivatives to a new concept. The main question in this chapter is whether one can find the area under a curve. The idea was introduced at the beginning of the course, and in this chapter, the methods to solve the problem will be discussed.

Rectangular Method

The rectangular method involves dividing an interval into equal subsections and creating a rectangle in each subsection to estimate the area under the curve. One can use the left, right, or midpoint endpoint to determine the height of the rectangle. The approximation of the area can be improved by increasing the number of rectangles or letting the space between each interval approach zero. As the space between intervals goes to zero, the number of rectangles can be infinitely increased, resulting in a more accurate estimate.

Anti-Derivative Method

The anti-derivative method is another approach to find the area under a curve. The area function, denoted as A(x), represents the area under the curve for some function f(x) over a given interval. Taking the derivative of the area function results in the original function, f(x). In section 4.3 and 4.4, the methods to find anti-derivatives will be explained.

Conclusion

After completing chapter four, the reader will be able to solve the main question in calculus, which is finding the area under a curve. The rectangular and anti-derivative methods will be introduced to approximate and solve the problem, respectively.

Introduction to Antiderivative Method

What you need to know right now is that if you are given an area function, take a derivative of that thing and it will give you your function back. Well, now that's cool, but we're never going to start with this. We're always going to start with our line, right? That's what we want to get to.

Finding the Area under a Curve

So, well, this implies this thing. This says, if we want to find the area under a certain function, we basically need to be able to undo this. We need to undo a derivative. For some interval. Let me go through this one time for you so you kind of get the interplay here. Here's what it says. It says, the area of a curve is A of X. What I know for sure is if I take the first derivative of the area, that's equivalent to my curve itself. So if I want to find that area under my curve, this thing is true, right? The first derivative of the area is the function. So if I want to find the area of the curve, under the curve, what I'm going to do is undo the derivative that gives me the area.

Antiderivative Method

So basically, here's the idea. You pretend that your function is a derivative. If you undo that thing and treat it like a derivative, you're going to find what's called the antiderivative. That is the area under the curve. That's the idea of the antiderivative method. We'll get more into it in a second. I'll prove it to you. Well, I'll prove it with an example. I have to prove it to you with 4.3 and 4.4 later on.

The Concept of Antiderivative

The idea is, can you find an antiderivative? I'm going to teach you that in a second, but I want you to understand the concept behind it as well. The concept is, we're trying to find the area under a curve. That's why I gave you this introduction. That's the idea. So I'm trying to get that in your head. Remember how I always kept saying, what's a derivative? What's a derivative? And you're like, oh, my gosh. Slow comparative point. You know that, right? Because I pounded it in your head. And that's going to do the same thing here. What we're doing is we're finding the area under a curve. That's what an antiderivative is.

Using an Example to Prove Antiderivative Method

What I've told you, and I've done it without proof. I'm not going to prove it until later. I've told you this. I've said, the first derivative of your area is your function. So if I can undo my function by treating it as a derivative, I will find the area function. So basically, we need to go backwards from a derivative. Did you get that? If the function is the first derivative of the area, that's what that says. The function is the first derivative of the area. If I can undo the derivative, I get my area. That's the idea. That's the antiderivative method in a nutshell. A very quick statement.

Finding the Formula for the Area on 1 to x

Now, let me do some of this with geometry to show you that it does, in fact, work. Then we'll get on into some antiderivatives and how to do those things. So, example. If we have a function f of x equals x plus 1, I'll give you something easy to graph because I'm going to teach you that in a second, but I want you to understand the concept behind it as well.

The concept is, we're trying to find the area under a curve. That's why I gave you this introduction. That's the idea. So I'm trying to get that in your head. Remember how I always kept saying, what's a derivative? What's a derivative? And you're like, oh, my gosh. Slow comparative point. You know that, right? Because I pounded it in your head. And that's going to do the same thing here.

What we're doing is we're finding the area under a curve. That's what an antiderivative is. What I've told you, and I've done it without proof. I'm not going to prove it until later. I've told you this. I've said, the first derivative of your area is your function. So if I can undo my function by treating it as a derivative, I will find the area function. So basically, we need to go backwards from a derivative. Did you get that?

If the function is the first derivative of the area, that's what that says. The function is the first derivative of the area. If I can undo the derivative, I get my area. That's the idea. That's the antiderivative method in a nutshell. A very quick statement.

Now, let me do some of this with geometry to show you that it does, in fact, work. Then we'll get on into some antiderivatives and how to do those things.

Example. If we have a function f of x equals x plus 1, I'll give you something easy to graph because I'm going to show you the graph in a second. I want us to find the formula for the area on 1 to x. Now, this would kind of be stupid if I gave you just 1 to 3 because we could just use the triangle and find the area. But what I want to find is 1 to x, and I'll show you why this works according to that.

First off, can you graph this? Geez, I hope so. What's your y-intercept? How much is your slope? Would you agree that that is your function? We're trying to find the area of that between, what did I say, negative 1? Oh, you know what? I want negative 1. Let's make that negative much more interesting. Negative 1 to x. Now, I don't know where x is. I made it positive, but it doesn't have to be positive. What we're talking about, wherever this x is, is the area of that shaded region.

Now, keep in mind that this function is x plus 1. What shape is that? Can you find the area of a triangle? Of course you can, yes. Let's find the area of a triangle. The area in terms of x, notice I'm using the same terminology I used over here, right? That's an area function. The area in terms of x, wherever x happens to be, is.

How do you find the area of a triangle again? Very good. One-half base intersection. So I'm going to write one-half base height, so that would be one-half, oh my gosh, what's the base? Let's think about that. What's the base? Is the base x? x minus 1, oh, close. How do you find the distance between two points? Between two numbers? You subtract them. You subtract the numbers, right? You subtract them. So this would be the distance between here and here is x minus, not 1, not 1 just basically one example showing that this is true for this example. Now it doesn't prove it at length. I'll prove it at length in the next video. But the idea is we have a function, we want to find the area under that curve. What we do is we take a derivative of an area function, and that gives us our original function. So if we want to find the area under the curve, we have to undo that derivative. And that's where the antiderivative comes in. We pretend that our function is a derivative and try to undo it. And when we undo it, we get the area function, which is the antiderivative.

Now, let me ask you a question. What's the derivative of a constant? It's zero, right? Well, the antiderivative of zero is just a constant. That's why when we find the antiderivative of a function, we always have to include the arbitrary constant of integration. And we denote that with a plus C. Because if you take the derivative of any constant, it's always zero. And when you undo that, you just get a constant.

So that's the basic idea behind antiderivatives. You want to find the area under a curve, you take the derivative of an area function, and that gives you the original function. And if you want to undo that derivative and find the area function, you find the antiderivative. And you always have to include the arbitrary constant of integration when you find the antiderivative.

Let's do one more example just to make sure we understand this. Let's say we have a function f(x) equals 2x. And we want to find the area under the curve from 0 to 5. Well, the antiderivative of 2x is just x squared plus C, where C is our constant of integration. Now we need to find that constant. So we know that the area under the curve from 0 to 5 is just the antiderivative evaluated at 5 minus the antiderivative evaluated at 0. So that's just 5 squared plus C minus 0 squared plus C. And that's just 25 plus C. So the area under the curve from 0 to 5 is just 25 plus C.

So that's the basic idea behind antiderivatives. We want to find the area under a curve, we take the derivative of an area function, and that gives us the original function. And if we want to undo that derivative and find the area function, we find the antiderivative. And we always have to include the arbitrary constant of integration when we find the antiderivative.

Introduction
 In this transcript, the speaker explains the anti-derivative method of finding the area under a curve. They use the example of the function f(x) = x^2 between 0 and 1 and show how to find the area using the anti-derivative method.

Simplifying the problem 
The speaker starts by simplifying the problem and shows the area under the curve between 0 and 1. They ask the audience if they see the area and if it is a triangle, which it is not. The speaker then introduces the idea that a function is equal to the first derivative of its area function and shows that for f(x) = x^2, the first derivative of its area function equals x^2.

Finding the area function 
The speaker then asks the question, "Can you find a function whose derivative is x^2?" They use common sense thinking to try different functions and show that x^3 does not work, but x^3/3 does. They explain that we are undoing the derivative, treating it like a derivative, and finding the anti-derivative method. They also explain that there are an infinite number of possibilities for the area function, which are represented by the constant C.

Explanation of C and the interval 
The speaker explains that C is the y-intercept of the area function and can be found by plugging in 0. They also explain that the interval is from 0 to X, and they use the example of finding the area from 0 to 0, which is the area of a single point.

Conclusion 
The speaker concludes by summarizing the anti-derivative method and how it can be used to find the area under a curve. They emphasize the importance of understanding the constant C and the interval, and how they can affect the result.

Setting X equals 0

When X equals 0, the interval becomes 0 to 0, which is the area under a single point, and it is always 0. In continuous distributions, the probability of an exact number is always 0 due to the infinite number of possibilities. Therefore, the area is 0 as well.

Finding C

After setting X equals 0, the next step is to find the value of C. Although C doesn't always have to be 0, in this case, it equals 0 since A of 0 equals 0 and A of 0 equals C. However, for initial value problems, some Cs can be numbers.

Calculating the Area

Once the value of C is determined, the area of the curve becomes X cubed over 3. Now, specific numbers can be plugged in to calculate the area.

Rectangular Method and Antiderivative Method

The rectangular method involves cutting the area into rectangles, while the antiderivative method involves finding the first root of the area, which is the function itself. To use the antiderivative method, we must find the value of C.

Indefinite Integral

An indefinite integral is the antiderivative of a function without any boundaries. It is called indefinite because we cannot find the definite area without knowing the starting and ending points. The antiderivative is represented by a capital letter, which is the area function of the curve.

Antiderivative Definition

An antiderivative of a function is a function that, when differentiated, produces the original function. It is represented by F, which is the area function of the curve. There can be infinitely many antiderivatives of a single function due to the inclusion of a constant term.

Example of Antiderivative

The capital F of X is the same as A of X, which represents the area. In the example given, the antiderivative of F of X is X cubed over three, which is only one of the many antiderivatives of the function.

Antiderivatives and the Family of Curves

In our study of calculus, we have reached a point where we are no longer focused solely on derivatives. We are now doing the opposite of a derivative, which involves finding antiderivatives. From our previous discussion, we learned that if a function has an area under its curve, that area is the antiderivative. Essentially, we need to undo a function by pretending it is a derivative and reversing the process.

The antiderivative is also referred to as integration, and the process of finding it is known as integration or anti-differentiation. These terms are synonymous and mean the same thing. When we hear the word integration or find the integral, we mean finding the antiderivative.

The Indefinite Integral and the Plus C Constant

The antiderivative of a function is represented by the family of curves, and any constant will not alter the derivative. This is why we have the plus C constant, which represents all the possible antiderivatives. We use it to avoid writing every constant over and over again.

It is important to note that antiderivatives of other functions will have different antiderivatives. Also, the constant C is significant and must be present in the antiderivative representation because it represents a family of curves for which the derivative gives back the original function. The constant C is essential and should not be forgotten.

The Integral Symbol and Notation

The integral symbol (∫) means finding the antiderivative, which is the opposite of differentiation. It is also referred to as finding the integral. The indefinite integral does not have any boundaries and represents an area function. We must plug a number into it to obtain an actual area. On the other hand, the definite integral allows us to plug in numbers to get areas out.

The dx notation tells us which variable we are integrating with respect to. It must be present and relevant to the variable. We can also interchange the notation to mean the same thing. For instance, finding the derivative of an antiderivative will give us the original function.

Conclusion

The study of antiderivatives and integration is critical to understanding calculus. We need to grasp the concept of finding antiderivatives as the opposite of differentiation. We should also note the importance of the constant C and understand the notation and symbols relevant to finding antiderivatives.

Integration Basics

Let's start with a problem that we have done several times before, the integral of x squared dx. This problem requires finding the antiderivative of the function with respect to the variable x. If the function and variable don't match up, it's impossible to solve the problem. We need to have the correct function to find its antiderivative. The solution to the integral of x squared dx is x cubed over three plus c, where c represents an arbitrary constant.

Integration Table

We can solve most integration problems using the basic integration table. It's essential to follow the table because there are many integration tables, and it's impossible to create your calculus. The table provides a derivative and the associated integral. We need to memorize the table, including the challenging trig integrals. The integrals are the reverse operation of derivatives. So, we should be able to find the integrals if we know the derivatives.

Integrals of Exponents

The derivative of x to the r power is r times x to the r minus 1. To find the antiderivative, we add 1 to the exponent and divide by the new exponent. For instance, the integral of x to the fifth is x to the sixth over six plus c.

Derivative vs. Integral

The derivative undoes the integral, and the integral undoes the derivative. They are inverse operations like division, multiplication, addition, and subtraction. When taking a derivative, we multiply and then subtract. When finding the antiderivative, we add and then divide by the new exponent.

So when I take a derivative of this, it will give me back x to the fourth. Right? It matches up perfectly. That's the whole idea. That's how we undo derivatives with integrals. Let's do another one. How about the integral of e to the x dx? What's the derivative of e to the x? It's e to the x. So we're just undoing that derivative. What's the integral of e to the x? It's just e to the x. Plus c. Why? Because when you take a derivative of that, it gives you back e to the x. So you see how we're undoing the derivative with the integral. That's the whole idea. That's how you get the antiderivative of a function. Let's do another one. How about the integral of sine x dx? What's the derivative of sine x? It's cosine x. So we're undoing that derivative. What's the integral of sine x? It's negative cosine x. Why negative? Because when you take a derivative of negative cosine x, it gives you back sine x. So that's why we have the negative sign there. Plus c. Let's do one more. How about the integral of cosine x dx? What's the derivative of cosine x? It's negative sine x. So we're undoing that derivative. What's the integral of cosine x? It's just sine x. Plus c. So you see how we're doing this? We're undoing the derivatives with the integrals. That's how you get the antiderivative of a function. And that's the basic integration table. There are more complicated integrals out there, but we'll get to those later. For now, just memorize these basic ones and you'll be good to go.

So that's the basic idea behind integration. We're finding the antiderivative of a function. And we can do that by undoing the derivative with the integral. We have a basic integration table that tells us how to do this for certain functions. And we just need to memorize those rules. It's important to remember that the integral of a function is not unique. There can be different antiderivatives of the same function. But we can always add a constant of integration to any antiderivative and it will still be valid. So don't forget that plus c at the end. It's crucial.

Let me give you some more examples. What about e to the x? What's the derivative of e to the x? e to the x. So what's the integral of e to the x? e to the x plus c. What about a constant times e to the x? What's the derivative of that? That's just a constant times e to the x. So what's the integral of a constant times e to the x? It's just that constant times e to the x plus c. Now let's do something a little bit harder. What's the derivative of sine of x? Cosine of x. What's the derivative of cosine of x? Negative sine of x. So what's the integral of sine of x? Negative cosine of x plus c. And what's the integral of cosine of x? Sine of x plus c. What about the integral of secant squared of x? That's a tough one. But we know that the derivative of tangent of x is secant squared of x. So if the derivative of tangent of x is secant squared of x, then the integral of secant squared of x is tangent of x plus c. What about the integral of 1 over 1 plus x squared? This is a tough one. But we know that the derivative of tangent inverse of x is 1 over 1 plus x squared. So if the derivative of tangent inverse of x is 1 over 1 plus x squared, then the integral of 1 over 1 plus x squared is tangent inverse of x plus c. What about the integral of the natural log of x? What's the derivative of the natural log of x? 1 over x. So what's the integral of 1 over x? The natural log of x plus c.

So that's the basic integration table. You're going to have to memorize all of those. But the good news is that most of them are very simple. It's just adding 1 to the exponent and dividing by the new exponent. The trig functions are a little bit harder, but you just have to memorize them. And then you can use these to find the antiderivative of a function. And then you can use that to find the area under a curve. So let's do some examples of that.

The Importance of Sine and Cosine

Sine and cosine are two of the most important functions in calculus, and it's crucial to understand them well. Unfortunately, people often make mistakes with sines, especially when dealing with positive and negative values. This can lead to errors when trying to differentiate or integrate functions involving sines.

Understanding Integration by Substitution

While most functions can be integrated using a set of standard tables, there are some exceptions. One example of an exception is integration by substitution, which is a relatively easy technique to use. However, it's important to note that the function you end up with after substitution still needs to fit into the standard tables.

Dealing with Non-Standard Functions

If a function doesn't fit into the standard tables, you won't be able to integrate it using the usual techniques. In this case, you need to find a way to manipulate the function so that it does fit into the standard tables. For example, you might need to change the exponent of a function to make it fit.

Step-by-Step Examples

To illustrate how to integrate functions using the power rule, the transcript provides step-by-step examples of several different functions. These examples include x to the fourth power, one over x cubed, and x to the one-half power. The transcript shows how to manipulate these functions to fit into the standard tables and provides the correct answers with explanations of how they were derived.

Limitations of the Power Rule

While the power rule is a powerful tool for integrating functions, there are some limitations. For example, the power rule only works if the exponent of the function is a whole number. If the exponent is a fraction or a negative number, you'll need to use a different technique to integrate the function.

Conclusion

Integrating functions is an important part of calculus, and understanding how to use the power rule is a key skill. By practicing with different types of functions and paying attention to details like positive and negative values, you can become more confident in your ability to integrate functions successfully.

Properties of Integrals

To start, we need to understand the properties of integrals. These properties are very similar to the properties of derivatives. If we have an integral of a constant times some function that has an x in it, we can take the constant outside of the integral. If we have two functions being added together within an integral, we can take the integral of the first one plus the integral of the second one. However, we cannot split up two integrals like that.

One thing to be cautious about is the c's. We must have plus c's, but we need to be careful about how to use them. We have options, and we can either put the plus c immediately or put it at the very end of the problem.

Examples of Integrals

Let's look at some examples of integrals to further understand how to use these properties. For example, if we have the integral of 2x, we can pull out the constant 2 and integrate x, giving us x squared over 2 plus c.

Another example is the integral of 1 plus x dx, which can be split up into the integral of 1 dx plus the integral of x dx. Here, we have to be cautious about the c's. We should ignore the c1 and c2 and just use c. So the answer would be x plus x squared over 2 plus c.

We can also use a shortcut with integrals, just as we can with derivatives. For example, the integral of 1 dx plus the integral of x dx can be directly simplified to x plus x squared over 2 plus c.

Multiplication of Functions

When we have functions of x multiplied together, there is no special rule for it. We cannot take the integral of one function times the integral of another. However, we can distribute and simplify the integral.

Some integrals may be off-limits for us in this class, but most of them we will be able to do as long as they fit our integration table. We must make sure that the integrals fit our integration table, even if we need to distribute or use other methods to simplify the integral.
-   To solve integrals, you need to memorize the integration table.
-   The integration table includes formulas for finding the integrals of different functions.
-   You can check your answer by differentiating it.
-   For integrals with fractions, you can't simply find the antiderivative and add a constant.
-   The integral of 1/x is ln absolute value x plus c.
-   The integral of e^x is e^x plus c.
-   If you have a constant times a function, it's the constant times the integral of the function dx.
-   If you have a product of functions, you can't split it apart, but there are other ways to solve it.
-   To solve integrals with polynomials, you need to break them apart and find the integral of each term separately.
  
  ## The Basics of Integrals
  
So that one we can't do yet. Integral of 4 cos x dx. Let's see. What do you do with the 4? Constants, we often do that. We really do. We say this is 4 times the integral of cos x dx. That makes it fit our table. That's easier to recognize. Constants, just don't forget about the 4. You've got the 4. The 4's going to be there being multiplied by whatever you get next.

## Breaking down Integrals

What do we get next? What's the integral of cos... Think about it before you answer. What's the integral of cos x dx? Negative or positive? Negative or positive? You should answer this way. When you take a derivative of it, does it give you positive cos x? Because that's what you're looking for. Sin x or negative sin x? Positive sin x. Remember, you can always check your work. No sense in getting the wrong answer here.

## The Basics of Integrals (Continued)

If you ever see parentheses around that, it doesn't really mean anything special. It just means you're taking the integral of the entire thing. This basically means the same thing as what I've been writing as this. Those parentheses just say everything's included in that. Do you see the difference there? There's really no... It's just grouping them. It's just saying this integral of the entire thing is not making anything special, no special multiplication or whatnot.

## Let's try Some Integrals

Can you take the integral of x? Do that now on your own. Take the integral of x. Write that out. You don't have to say it, just write it out. The integral of x is 1, true or false? False. What is it? You can write 1 half x squared or you can do x squared over 2. Plus, because we have a plus. Say, we can separate them by addition. That means we can just do them piece by piece if they're being added or subtracted.

## Working with Multiple Terms

The integral of x squared, what's that? x cubed over 3 over 9. I'm going to assume your mumblings were x cubed over 3. I think some of you said that actually. And then what? No 2c's, just plus. That's all we want. That's pretty much it. How many people understand the basic idea of integrals? We're going to practice a whole lot more of this. I'll show you things we can and can't do. Next time. We're still doing some integrals, our anti-differentiation, going backwards from a derivative, backwards of what a derivative is.

## Integrating Multiple Terms

Let's go ahead and talk about that problem. That's what we're going to start off with. Let's get our brains a little motivated. When it says an integral, that means find the anti-derivative of whatever function in terms of this variable that I give you. This says with respect to x, so our function has to be in terms of x. That's what we're integrating with respect to. When we have 2x to the 5th minus 3x squared plus 4x minus 8, do I have to necessarily split that up term by term or can I just find the integral of each little piece? With addition and subtraction, each little piece is fine. With multiplication, division, each little piece is not fine. We knew that integrals, just like derivatives, were separable by addition and subtraction.

## Solving for Integrals

Let'sgo ahead and talk about that problem.

Let's go ahead and talk about that problem. That's what we're going to start off with. Let's get our brains a little motivated. When it says an integral, that means find the anti-derivative of whatever function in terms of this variable that I give you. This says with respect to x, so our function has to be in terms of x. That's what we're integrating with respect to.

When we have 2x to the 5th minus 3x squared plus 4x minus 8, do I have to necessarily split that up term by term or can I just find the integral of each little piece? With addition and subtraction, each little piece is fine. With multiplication, division, each little piece is not fine. We knew that integrals, just like derivatives, were separable by addition and subtraction. What that says is it allows you to do the integral of this piece minus the integral of this piece plus the integral of this piece minus the integral of this piece and then jam it all back together.

Let's go ahead and take this integral. What's the integral of 2x to the 5th? Can you tell me? x to the 10th over 10? Oh, no, not quite. Is the 2 still going to be there? Well, you're going to reduce it now. Okay, but is it going to be there when we start? Let's do that. This little piece, that 2 is a constant, right? When we take an integral, just like a derivative, it doesn't do much. In fact, if you were to write this up, you'd write your constant in front of your integral. Now, we're a little beyond that. We just do the integral as we did derivatives. We look at it, we do it piece by piece. So we say this is a 2. No problem. The x to the 5th, what's the x to the 5th become? x to the 4th or x to the 6th? y to the 6th. Over what? 6. Yes, the new exponent is what you divide by. Okay, 2x to the 6th over the 6th before we start simplifying. Are you following me on this so far? Again, you know what? It's probably useful to check this with a derivative at some point. If you took a derivative here, notice you're going to get 2x to the 5th. That's nice. You can check that. Make sure you have this right.

Minus, let's see the next piece. How about 3x squared? What's the integral of 3x squared? Okay, I like the way you said 3x to the 3rd over 3 because I'm going to simplify it in a moment. I'm going to write out the integrals just like they are and then I'll simplify it just like that. Are we okay so far? Plus... plus what? 4x squared over 2. Very good. You sound like my little drums today. 4x squared over 2. That's good. No emotion, but at least you're right. Fantastic. And then the minus 8 goes to 0, right? Because all constants go to... Oh wait. When do constants go to 0? We're not doing derivatives. We're going backwards with that. So if a constant goes to 0 in a derivative, a constant goes with an x in an integral. So this goes minus 8x. And that's it, right? Over 1, I guess you can go all the way through. The instructor then proceeds to explain how to take the integral of trigonometric functions. They start with the integral of sine x dx. The instructor asks the class to take a derivative of cosine x to show that it is negative sine x. They then explain that the integral of sine x dx is equal to negative cosine x plus C.

Next, the instructor talks about the integral of cosine x dx. They ask the class to take the derivative of sine x to show that it is equal to cosine x. They then explain that the integral of cosine x dx is equal to sine x plus C.

The instructor then talks about the integral of tangent x dx. They explain that it is equal to negative ln absolute value cosine x plus C. They ask the class to take the derivative of ln absolute value cosine x to show that it is equal to negative tangent x.

The instructor then talks about the integral of cotangent x dx. They explain that it is equal to ln absolute value sine x plus C. They ask the class to take the derivative of ln absolute value sine x to show that it is equal to cotangent x.

Next, the instructor talks about the integral of secant x dx. They explain that it is equal to ln absolute value secant x plus tangent x plus C. They ask the class to take the derivative of ln absolute value secant x plus tangent x to show that it is equal to secant x.

Finally, the instructor talks about the integral of cosecant x dx. They explain that it is equal to negative ln absolute value cosecant x plus cotangent x plus C. They ask the class to take the derivative of negative ln absolute value cosecant x plus cotangent x to show that it is equal to cosecant x.

The instructor concludes by saying that there are many other types of integrals that they will cover in future lessons, but these are the basic ones that students should be familiar with. They encourage the class to practice solving integrals on their own to gain a better understanding of the concepts.

Methods for Integrating Trigonometric Functions

When dealing with integrals of trigonometric functions, it is crucial to make them match something on the integration table. They must be exact matches, and missing even a small piece can render the integral unsolvable. If an integral does not match anything on the table, it must be manipulated until it does. Breaking up the integral and using known trigonometric identities can help with this process.

One method involves splitting the integral into fractions over sine, which can be translated into other trig functions that may be on the integration table. For example, 1 over sine can be rewritten as cosecant times tangent. It is essential to refer to the integration table and memorize the identities to identify what can be used for manipulation. Once the integral matches something on the table, it can be solved.

Manipulating Integrals to Match the Integration Table

When an integral does not match anything on the integration table, it must be manipulated until it does. One common strategy is to factor out terms and break them up over a common denominator. This approach can simplify fractions and make them solvable.

It is also essential to pay attention to the variables used in the integral. If the integral is in terms of x, then all variables in the integral must also be in terms of x. If the variables are in terms of another variable, such as t, then the integral cannot be solved until the variables are consistent.

Finding the Equation of a Curve

To find the equation of a curve such that the slope at each point is x squared, we need to find the antiderivative of x squared. The question asks for an equation that, when differentiated, will give x squared as the slope at any point.

The process involves finding the antiderivative of x squared, which is x cubed over three. This equation is the answer to the question, and when differentiated, the slope at any point is x squared.

Integrals versus Derivatives

Integrals are often more challenging than derivatives, but with practice and familiarity with the integration table and known identities, they can be solved. It is crucial to remember that missing even a small piece can make the integral unsolvable, and variables must be consistent throughout the equation.

## The Derivative and its Antiderivative

The derivative means a slope at any point, represented as dy/dx. The slope in this case is x squared. To undo this, we need to find the equation that gives us this slope. We do that by taking the integral of x squared dx. It is interesting to see where all the symbols come from, and we notice that if we treat dx as a variable and multiply it, we get dy = x squared dx. This means that an integral undoes a derivative on both sides.

## The Integral and the Equation of a Curve

When we take the integral of dy, we get y, which is 1 dy with respect to y. Therefore, the integral of x squared dx is equal to y. The general equation for this is y = x cubed/3 + c, where c is a constant. The equation represents a family of functions, each with a different y-intercept. To find a specific equation, we need to choose a value for c. For instance, if we are given that the curve passes through the point (2, 1), we can find c by plugging in the values of x and y into the equation. Then we can use this value of c to obtain a specific equation that passes through that point.

## Initial Value Problems and Differential Equations

An initial value problem involves finding a specific solution to a differential equation based on some initial condition. This is similar to finding a specific equation that passes through a certain point. To solve such problems, we need to find an antiderivative, which is a function that, when differentiated, gives us the original function. For example, if we have dy/dx = x to the fourth, we can find the antiderivative by integrating x to the fourth dx, which gives us x to the fifth/5 + c. The solution to a differential equation is not one equation, but a family of equations. However, we can find a specific solution by adding an initial value condition, which gives us a specific value for c. An example of an initial value problem is dy/dx = 1/(2x)^q, where y(1) = 0.

## Conclusion

In summary, we saw how to find the antiderivative of a function by taking the integral. We also learned about initial value problems and how they help us find a specific solution to a differential equation. These concepts are crucial in mathematics and have many applications in various fields.

Finding the Antiderivative

Our first task is to undo the derivative by finding the antiderivative of the given function. To do this, we need to use the integral or anti-derivative concept. We can't take the integral of the derivative of y which is 1 over 2x to the third power directly. We need to split it into two parts. One way to do this is to bring the bottom to the top, but we have to be careful with the fractions. Another way is to first deal with the parentheses by moving the negative exponent up to the numerator. Either way, we get the same result, which is negative 1 over 16x squared plus C.

Understanding the Family of Functions

The result of our antiderivative is a family of functions that can help us solve the problem. This family of functions represents a set of curves that when we take the derivative of any one of them, it will give us the value of the given function. To find a specific curve or function, we need to use the initial value. In this case, the initial value is y of 1 equals 0. We can solve for C by substituting these values into the antiderivative equation. The result is a specific equation that satisfies the differential equation and the initial value.

Example: Solving for y of x

To further illustrate how to solve for y of x, we take another example where dy dx equals cosine x, and the initial value is y of 0 equals 1. We can find the antiderivative of cosine x, which is sine x plus C. We can then use the initial value to solve for C, which is 1. Substituting this value back into the antiderivative equation gives us the specific equation y of x equals sine x plus 1, which satisfies the differential equation and the initial value.

Conclusion

To solve a differential equation, we need to find the antiderivative of the given function, which gives us a family of functions that can satisfy the differential equation. To find a specific function, we need to use the initial value, which helps us solve for the constant of integration. The result is an equation that satisfies both the differential equation and the initial value.

Introduction

"It's kind of nice" is a statement that leads to an explanation of how an integral always has a constant term that disappears when the variable is zero. The author then proceeds to give a real-life example of a catapult and what happens when a projectile is launched straight up in the air.

The Catapult Example

The author discusses the example of a badly built catapult that shoots a projectile straight up in the air with an initial velocity of 128 feet per second. The author wants to find the position function of the projectile, its maximum height, and the time it takes for the projectile to hit the ground.

Position Function

The author discusses the position function s(t) and how the initial height of the projectile is 16 feet, which is when it is launched. The initial velocity of the projectile is 128 feet per second.

Velocity and Acceleration

The author discusses the relationship between velocity and a position function, and how velocity is the first derivative of a position function. The initial velocity at time 0 is 128 feet per second. The author then introduces the concept of acceleration and how it is the second derivative of a position function. The acceleration is negative 32 feet per second squared.

Goals

The author discusses the goals of finding the position function, the maximum height of the projectile, and the time it takes for the projectile to hit the ground.

Conclusion

The author summarizes the information discussed in the text, which includes the example of the catapult, the position function, velocity and acceleration, and the goals of finding the maximum height and time to hit the ground.

Understanding Projectile Motion: Breaking Down the Acceleration

-   Explanation of acceleration due to gravity and its constant negative value of 32 feet per second squared
-   Discussion of how velocity changes at a rate of 32 feet per second every second
-   Exploring how to work backwards from acceleration to find other functions, noting the lack of position and velocity functions
-   Introducing the concept of integrating the second derivative to obtain the first derivative
-   Solving for the velocity function using s prime of t equals the integral of s double prime of t
-   Emphasizing the need for the plus C constant in integration
-   Using initial velocity information to solve for the constant in the velocity function
-   Noting that the position function is still unknown
-   Explaining how the maximum height can be found by finding where velocity equals zero
-   Recognizing that the position function must be found first to fully determine the maximum height
-   Introducing the idea of integrating the velocity function to find the position function
-   Demonstrating the integration process step-by-step and pointing out the negative 16t squared term that arises due to gravity
- 
  Part Two: Finding the Maximum Height

To find the maximum height, we need to plug in the time it takes to reach the maximum height into the position function we found earlier. This occurs when the velocity is zero, so we set the first derivative of the position function equal to zero and solve for t. In our case, we get t = 4 seconds.

Now that we know the time at which the maximum height is reached, we can plug it into the position function to find the actual height. The result is 272 feet, not 784 feet as previously stated (due to a calculation error).

Part Three: Finding the Time to Hit the Ground

To find the time at which the object hits the ground, we need to set the position function equal to zero and solve for t. This gives us a quadratic equation, which has two solutions (one positive and one negative). The positive solution is the time at which the object hits the ground, while the negative solution is meaningless in this context.

Conclusion

In conclusion, we can use calculus to model the motion of a projectile launched from an initial height with an initial velocity under the influence of gravity. By finding the position function, we can determine the maximum height and time to hit the ground. However, this model does not take into account factors such as wind resistance or propulsion and is limited to objects launched from a stationary position.
