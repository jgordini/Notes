Hi, welcome to another video. So in this video, we're going to discover how to determine if a rational function has a horizontal asymptote. That's about it.

Header: Types of Asymptotes
The next video will study oblique or slant asymptotes. Then we'll talk about end behavior. We'll kind of practice finding all the asymptotes and holes of a function. And then we're going to put this thing all together in graph. It'll be the longest video in this series.

Header: Horizontal Asymptotes of Rational Functions
So in this video, when we talk about a horizontal asymptote, it's very similar to a vertical asymptote that we discovered. Vertical asymptotes like a force field and you cannot touch it with the function. It will not touch. Horizontal asymptotes are not coarse vertical. They're horizontal and there are some different qualities. So here's how to determine if or when you have a horizontal asymptote of a rational function.

Header: Determining Horizontal Asymptotes
So here's what we're going to do. We're going to look at our function and we're going to look at the rational part as a polynomial over a polynomial. That's what defines a rational function. Anyhow, we're going to look at the leading term of the numerator and the leading term of the denominator. If you remember, the leading term is the term of the largest exponent in a polynomial. So basically you want your rational function in order of both polynomials in order. Then we take a look at basically the first two terms and we look at the degree. Remember, the degree is the power of your leading term of a polynomial. If the degree of the denominator, the bottom of your function is larger than the degree of the numerator, you are going to have a horizontal asymptote at zero. y equals zero just like this, right on the x-axis, no matter what. If the degree of the denominator equals the degree of the numerator, you're going to have a horizontal asymptote at whatever the leading coefficient say, whatever the ratio is. We're going to practice that. Now, this is a really easy way to remember what to do. As we go through it, I'm going to explain why this actually works because a lot of times students get this, they try to memorize it, they get it all screwed up. So I'm going to explain to you why this is the way it is.

Header: Degree of Numerator and Denominator
So we're going to be looking at a degree of denominator, degree of numerator. Those are both polynomials. We're going to consider the two cases that we can have for greater than or equal to. So a horizontal asymptote will exist if the degree of the denominator is greater than or equal to the degree of the numerator. We're just kind of determined which is which. If the degree of the denominator is bigger than the numerator, then you're going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals zero. If the degree of the denominator is equal to the degree of the numerator, we're going to have a horizontal asymptote at y equals the leading coefficients. We'll use that ratio. We'll talk about y, we'll talk about limits a little bit.

Header: Summary and Types of End Behavior
The two notes I really need you to know, I mentioned this just a minute ago with the number two first. And behavior is always determined by leading terms. Well, that's true for rational functions as well, except that on a rational function, you have two polynomials, one on the numerator and one on the denominator. So you basically have two leading terms. And that determines the n


ChatGPT:
Header: Example and Application
As we move on, this video really could be a lot longer if I included every possible n behavior, but I'm breaking it up. I'm breaking up these videos as horizontal asymptotes, oblique or slant asymptotes, and then this n behavior where those don't exist. That is all types of n behavior functions. A horizontal asymptote is n end behavior. So as you go to the end of your function, what's happening? Is it tending to one y value? Well, that would be a horizontal asymptote. As we go to the end of our function, are we tending to be along a diagonal line? Well, that would be oblique or a slant asymptote. Or as we go to the end of our function, are we tending to be like a parabola or maybe a cubic? Well, that's also n behavior. It's all one idea. We're just kind of categorizing two specific types.

Header: Types of End Behavior of Rational Functions
So here's what I want in your head right now. I want that n behavior or rational functions can be basically one of three things. Number one, you could have a horizontal asymptote in either of these cases. Number two, you could have a slant asymptote. That's a diagonal. If the degree of the numerator is one larger than the denominator, that's what's going to happen. Or you could have it where you don't have that case where the degree of the numerator is larger than the degree of the denominator. In that case, you're just going to get straight up n behavior like a cubic or a quadratic. They're all n behaviors, but you've fallen in one of those three cases. Let me make this very clear. You will never have both a horizontal asymptote and a slant asymptote. It can't happen. It's either horizontal or slant or neither. And you have some other n behaviors. So keep it in your head for the next few videos.

Header: Conclusion and Example
So let's go back to this. n behaviors always determined by leading terms. I'm going to fill this one out in just a second. Well, let's look at f of x. f of x is 4x cubed minus 7x plus 1 over 7x to the fifth plus 2x cubed minus 3. The leading terms are the terms of the biggest power. So the largest exponent in a polynomial. If you put them in order, they're always first. So when we look at our leading terms, leading terms of the numerators for x cubed and leading terms of the denominator is 7x to the fifth. Now here's what we learned. We learned that n behavior is basically modeled by that. Well, for this bottom polynomial, it's basically modeled by that. So for our function itself, our function's n behavior is going to look approximately like 4x to the third over 7x to the fifth. Now I want you to think about this for a second. If you just think about this and do this, it's going to work. This is a nice shortcut on how to determine number one, if you're going to have a horizontal asymptote and number two which type it's going to be. So we can do that really quick. We can do that really quick. We can live in the OKK. The degree of the numerator is 3. The degree of the denominator is 5. So let's go through it. Is the degree of the denominator greater than or equal to the degree of the numerator? Yes, it is. This is 5. That is bigger than or equal

Header: Introduction
But in our head, we know that's going to happen. Now I want to show you why. So that's kind of a shortcut on how you do it.

Header: Leading Coefficients and Rational Functions
Yeah, look at the degree. Gray is it bigger than? Cool. y equals 0. Is it equal? All right. y equals the leading coefficients. We'll talk about that. Now, why is that? Well, if you think about n behavior as being the leading terms, notice what you can do. Here, we took the leading term of 4x cubed over 7x to the fifth. We said, yeah, our n here is going to look about like that.

Header: Simplifying Leading Terms
Well, let's simplify that. If we simplify that right now, we would simplify and get x to the second power. That's 4 over 7x squared. And then we do a little bit of imagining. You think, you think critically, you think if this is how our function is going to behave, as we get really, really big and really, really small on the x-axis. So really positive and really needed. This is how it's going to be able to follow this for sure, positively. And we can simplify it to make it easier to think about.

Header: Approaching Zero
Now, the reason why we simplify it's really difficult to think about x getting very large in both a numerator and a denominator when they both have variables. That's very difficult. So with our leading terms, really focus here, with our leading terms, we should always be able to simplify so that either our numerator or our denominator x's disappear. That is always the case.

Now, here's why that's the case. We have leading terms, which are always power functions. Power functions always have one variable raised to an exponent. If we have one of those in the numerator and one of those in the denominator and you're in the same variable, you can always simplify them. So taking your rational function and your leading terms and both polynomials, putting them in a ratio, you can always simplify them. So do it. And then think about it. This is much easier to think about. Think about what's going to happen when you really think, stop, do not fast forward this video, really think about this.

When you take x and make it very, very large, positively, or I know it's kind of oxymoronical, but very, very large, negatively, think about that. What's going to happen to the four? If I start taking x and putting in really big values for x, what's going to happen to the four? Nothing. The four is going to stay the same. What's going to happen to you seven x squared as x gets closer to like a billion, a trillion, like way more than that.

Well, closer infinity is what we'd say positive infinity, four divided by a number that's enormous, like really, really large, four divided by a billion. I mean, that's all we're already really small. Imagine us imagine taking four dollars and dividing it amongst a billion people. Are those people going to get a lot of money? No, they're going to get hardly nothing. They're getting basically nothing. You don't even have a monetary value for that. We don't even have stuff that small. Now, a billion's not even close to infinity, not even remotely close. So take four and divide it by a billion billions. What's that value going to get close to? Not equal. That's not what limits are about.

Limits are about what's your function getting

Header: Simplifying Leading Terms

Now, let's delve a little deeper into simplifying leading terms. As mentioned earlier, simplifying leading terms is important because it allows us to easily determine the end behavior of a function. It is also necessary when we are dealing with power functions, which always have one variable raised to an exponent.

When we have a rational function with leading terms that are both polynomials, we can put them in a ratio and simplify them. This means that if we have one of those variables in the numerator and one in the denominator and they are the same variable, we can always simplify them.

The reason why we simplify is that it can be difficult to think about x getting very large in both the numerator and the denominator when they both have variables. Therefore, we simplify the expression to make it easier to think about.

Header: Approaching Zero

Now, let's discuss what happens when we take x and make it very large positively or very large negatively. As x gets really big, the function gets really close to zero. However, it will never equal zero, and it will never intersect the x


ChatGPT:
Horizontal Asymptotes

Let's start with the definition of a limit. A limit tells us what a function is approaching as we get closer and closer to some x value. One important concept in calculus is the idea of end behavior, where the function goes left and right forever to positive and negative infinity. We can have different types of end behavior, such as odd or even polynomials, and 1/x, 1/x^2, and 1/x^3.

For horizontal asymptotes, we're not talking about x-intercepts or vertical asymptotes. Instead, we're concerned with whether or not we're dealing with a horizontal asymptote. When we take a look at our leading terms of polynomials, we have to check if the degree of the denominator is greater than or equal to the degree of the numerator. If they're equal, we're going to have a horizontal asymptote, but it's not going to be at 0. We take the fraction of the leading coefficients and simplify.

We'll never actually reach the horizontal asymptote, but we can cross it. This is different from vertical asymptotes, which are completely undefined and cannot be touched.

Example: g(x) = 8x^3 - 2x + 3 / 2x^3 + x^2 - 7x + 5
The degree of the numerator and denominator are the same, so we know we have a horizontal asymptote. To find the value of the asymptote, we take the fraction of the leading coefficients and simplify. In this case, y = 4 is the horizontal asymptote. As x approaches positive and negative infinity, g(x) approaches 4.

To fully grasp the concept of limits and end behavior, it's important to understand horizontal asymptotes and how to determine them.

Header: Understanding Degree and Horizontal Asymptotes
That's why we have that. That just horizontal asymptote at 4 because it can't change. It's going to be that the function is going to approach that. So I want you to get that. I want you to understand that really the basics are looking to degree, just compare them. If the degree of the denominator is bigger than the numerator, you have a horizontal asymptote at zero. If they are equal, you have a horizontal asymptote at the coefficients of your leading terms. That's it.

Header: Next Steps with Degree and Horizontal Asymptotes
You probably should have a question, right? You should have a question. What happens if the degree of the numerator is larger than the denominator? Well, we have two more cases. And that's the next two videos. The next video is what if the degree of the numerator is larger by one? Well, then we have, wait a minute, what would happen? Think about it. What would happen? If the degree of the numerator is larger by one, you take n behavior just like this and just like this, but you'd simplify what would happen if you get, I'm just making this up, a numerator larger by one. Well, your power function would still simplify and you would get 4x. Well, what's 4x? Wait a minute. 4x looks a lot like slope intercept form. The slope is 4x to the first power would be a diagonal line. That's called no bleak asymptote. That's what we're going to say in the next video. What if the degree of the numerator is larger by more than one? So what if it's like x to the sixth? Well, then you get x squared. Do you know what your n behavior should look like? A parabola. That's all there is to it. We're just making n behavior.

Header: Exploring Other Types of Asymptotes
Where it gets a little complicated is these are two n behaviors you haven't seen before. Where we have a horizontal asymptote to zero, horizontal asymptote at a constant. That's basically it. So I'll come back with another video about oblique or shellant asymptotes or something else called and then it out will continue.

asymptotes is to compare the degrees
and leading coefficients of the numerator
and denominator polynomials, and for vertical
asymptotes, you set the denominator
equal to zero and solve for x. 

Finding Vertical Asymptotes:

To find the vertical asymptote of a function, we need to set the denominator equal to zero and solve for x. The values we get for x are the vertical asymptotes. 

For example, in the given function x^2=3, the vertical asymptote values are x = ±√3.

When we have a trinomial in the denominator, we need to look for factoring and solve for x. For instance, in the function (x + 6)(x + 1) = 0, the vertical asymptote values are x = -6 and x = -1.

Finding Horizontal Asymptotes:

To find the horizontal asymptote of a function, we compare the degrees and leading coefficients of the numerator and denominator polynomials.

When the degree of the numerator is less than the degree of the denominator, the horizontal asymptote is y = 0.

When the degrees of the numerator and denominator are equal, we divide the coefficients of the leading terms of the numerator and denominator to find the horizontal asymptote.

When the degree of the numerator is greater than the degree of the denominator, there is no horizontal asymptote.
