Two lovers sat on a park bench, with their bodies touching each other, holding hands in the moonlight.  
The woman said to her beloved: "I love you so much."  
"And I love you," he replied. "But tell me something first. How do you know that?"  
She smiled and leaned forward, placing her head against his chest.  
She could hear the clicking of his mechanical heart. So much of him had been surgically repaired. She was not sure how much of the real him was left. But still she loved him.  
"When we first met," she said, "you told me that your heart would stop if I ever fell out of love with you but it did stop. Your electronic heart still contains the sparks of our love."  
He put his hand over hers and squeezed gently. He knew what it meant when a human heart stopped beating. It meant that the spark of life was gone forever. Yet he still lived on. He no longer understood the stars. His mind could only understand the impulses from his nervous system. The electrical signals from his brain were a meaningless haze. And yet... there they were.  
They embraced tightly and held each other for an eternity. When they finally let go, there was nothing left between them except a single tear. They both wiped it away.  
The tear was absorbed through the pores of his synthetic epithelium, causing small electrical shorts that cascaded from his fingers.  
The hairs on his neck stood up, but he was calm. He glanced at the sky. It was the color of burnt orange. He could smell the sulfer odor of ozone in the air, mixing with the scent of roses. The air around him was filled with static electricity.  
He felt like he was floating above himself surrounded by blackness, illuminated by millions of tiny pinpoints of light.  
He saw all the people who had once touched his body. All those whom he had known. Those who had loved him. Now scattered across time and space. She was looking directly at the sun. Her eyes glowed bright white. She too seemed to be floating in darkness. A smile crossed her face as she looked into his eyes. Then she turned away, unable to bear the sight of herself any longer.  
Then suddenly everything went dark again. He heard voices in the distance. As the lights came back on in the park, he noticed that he wasn't alone anymore. He felt someone else's arms around him.  
A man walked up to them and asked, "Are you two okay? You look pretty beat up."  
The girl responded. "Yes, thank you. We're fine."  
The man nodded. "You should probably get some rest before you leave here tonight. There are a lot of dangerous things roaming this place after sunset."  
The boy whispered to his girlfriend, "Can you see anything?" Her pupils dilated until they were black holes of nothingness, suffocating him. Gasping for breath he grasped at the bench and it splintered beneath his fingers. There was no escape. Suddenly, he found himself standing outside the hospital doors.  
His heart sank as he realized that there was no way home unless he could find his own body. He didn't even remember where he'd parked his car. In fact, he couldn't remember anything about himself. What was his name? Where had he come from? Was he dead or alive? His skin burned and his mouth opened, wet tentacles fed him. The nurse smiled at him. Watching the IV drain into his arms.  
His body disintegrated until there was nothing left but a pile of ash. A priest marked him with the sacrament. "Remember that you are dust and to dust you shall return." A giant creature was emerging in his peripheral vision. Its legs were long enough to reach the ground and its tail was curled around itself forming a tentacle-like appendage.  
Suddenly, the young man awoke in bed. Everything was the same. The room was the same. Even the sheets looked exactly the same. A porcelain doll was on the bedside table. He reached out and ran his fingertips down her cheek. Nothing happened. He tried again without touching her. Still nothing. Moonlight poured in through the window illuminating every detail of the room, including the little porcelain figurine sitting next to his bed.  
He sat down on the edge of the bed and stared at the doll. He remembered holding her in his hands while waiting for the doctor. How strange that such a beautiful thing could have been so easily lost. He touched one of her delicate features. Her hair was made of purest silk. All is forgotten. I am a doll and the doll is me. Hysterical his erection penetrated the soft flesh. It was sticky with cum. Tongues curled around it and massaged it. He heard moaning escaping from his lips. But he was still paralyzed. Unable to move.  
Reaching over, he grabbed the doll and pulled it close. He kissed the tip of her nose then put her back on the nightstand. Again, his cock stiffened. He placed his hand on the bed and it split open. The mattress slid off the frame and fell to the floor. The headboard crashed against the wall. The walls cracked and collapsed inward. The ceiling caved in and fell upon him crushing him under its weight. He screamed. But no sound emerged from his throat. He struggled desperately to free himself from the rubble but to no avail. His lungs were burning and his limbs were useless. He thought he might die trapped inside this endless nightmare. He knew he would never wake up again. The nurse smiled at him. He drowned in cum.  
It was morning when he finally woke up. He was lying naked on an old wooden bench.  
He slowly untied the rope binding his ankles together. When he was able to stand upright. He turned and stared back at the bench. A crumpled piece of paper was stuck between one of the boards. On the note, written in loopy handwriting, was a single word: "Ride".  
He took a deep breath and climbed onto the bench. He pushed himself forward until he was seated behind the wheel. Slowly, he began turning the key. The engine roared to life. He drove the vehicle toward the mountains. Flying rocks bounced off the hood like bullets from a machine gun.  
When he arrived at the top of the mountain, he stopped the car and stepped out. He gazed out across the vast landscape below him. No other cars were visible anywhere near him. With each step, the earth moved further away from him. Finally, he stood at the very end of the world.
