Two lovers sat on a park bench, with their bodies touching each other, holding hands in the moonlight.  
The woman said to her beloved: "I love you so much."  
"And I love you," he replied. "But tell me something first. How do you know that?"  
She smiled and leaned forward, placing her head against his chest.  
She could hear the clicking of his mechanical heart. So much of him had been surgically repaired. She was not sure how much of the real him was left. But still she loved him.  
"When we first met," she said, "you told me that your heart would stop if I ever fell out of love with you but it did stop. Your electronic heart still contains the sparks of our love."  
He put his hand over hers and squeezed gently. He knew what it meant when a human heart stopped beating. It meant that the spark of life was gone forever. Yet he still lived on. He no longer understood the stars. His mind could only understand the impulses from his nervous system. The electrical signals from his brain were a meaningless haze.  
"You are my world," he whispered as tears rolled down his cheeks. "My universe."  
"I am yours too," she answered softly.  
They embraced tightly and held each other for an eternity. When they finally let go, there was nothing left between them except a single tear. They both wiped it away.  
The tear was absorbed through the pores of his synthetic epithelium, causing small electrical shorts that cascaded from his fingers.  
The hairs on his neck stood up, but he was calm. He glanced at the sky. It was the color of burnt orange. He could smell the sulfer odor of ozone in the air, mixing with the scent of roses. The air around him was filled with static electricity. He looked back at the bench where he and his beloved had shared so many tender moments together, and he saw a faint image. A ghostly fog enveloped her and she evaporated. Gripped by nausea he shakily stood up and walked towards the road. Cars buzzed around him. He reached into his pocket and pulled out a scrap of paper. On it was written:  
Love is all that matters. Love is eternal.  
Forget about mortality. Live forever. - AVINA  
It was the surgery clinic they had visited in the fall of last year. He had paid them his life savings and spent several months recovering there. When he woke up he found himself to have aged 10 years and his wife was dead.  
He used to read her old love letters every night before going to sleep. He couldn't remember what he had written.  
A car swerved and honked its horn at him. He ignored it. Then another one passed close enough behind such that exhaust fumes wafting off made contact with his face; stinging like acid rain hitting concrete or glass splinters being rubbed onto skin after coming across sandpaper while walking barefoot along gravel roadsides during summer days under full sun glare...or even worse than either!  
His body convulsively jerked backwards violently then forwards again despite having lost control due to electric shock caused by rubbing metal fragments embedded within broken pieces of windshields inside cars passing near-by which may also be carrying those who think themselves more important because others don't share common interests nor appreciate differences among people unlike us humans whose hearts beat faster whenever someone says "hi" – just sayin'.  
       
Then came visions…dreams..memories? What else can explain this phenomenon called ‘love?' Who knows?? Maybe some higher power sent these thoughts/visions directly straight into space itself without any intermediary devices (iPads) connected via wireless internet access....who cares??? There's gotto'be somethingsomething beyond explanation here!!! Something BIGGER!! Get yer minds OUTTA SIGHT!!!! We're dealing WITH THE SUPERNATURAL HERE!!!!!!!! And yes maybe THAT IS WHAT LIFE REALLY MEANS TO BE ABOUT INDEED!!!!!"
