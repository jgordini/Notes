Here are four online annual reports I liked (and what I liked about them):

[https://www.bu.edu/ar/2021/academics/](https://www.bu.edu/ar/2021/academics/ "https://www.bu.edu/ar/2021/academics/"): Portraits mixed with hand-drawn elements

[https://annual-report-2019.possiblehealth.org/](https://annual-report-2019.possiblehealth.org/ "https://annual-report-2019.possiblehealth.org/"): Overlays, simple images, links, metrics

> From the moment the pandemic forced us to pause campus life and conduct operations virtually, our goal was to reunite students and faculty in the classrooms, labs, and studios as soon as was safely possible. And in 2020, we did just that.
But getting there was no small task.

> ### UAB Steps into the spotlight

Students in the School of Engineering — and across campus — have access to the software they need, no matter what device they are using, thanks to the virtual solution UAB Anywhere.

[UABAnywhere](http://go.uab.edu/uabanywhere) is a Citrix Cloud virtual desktop solution, allowing you to access a virtual user desktop in a virtual environment. That means when you don't have access to a classroom, lab or office computer, you can still connect to it from another machine and have access to the same software and programs.

> "I think the partnership with UAB School of Engineering and UAB IT has benefited both of us with respect to information technology, but primarily providing our students with better remote capability to use the Engineering software we teach with," said Tommy Foley, director of information technology for the School of Engineering.
