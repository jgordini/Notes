[_Tally_](http://help.dyalog.com/18.0/index.htm#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Tally.htm), monadic `≢`, gives the number of major cells in an array, kind of like Python’s [len()](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#len):

≢7 5 1 2 9
≢'Hello world'

# Tally
R←≢Y
Y may be any array.  R is a simple numeric scalar.
Tally returns the number of major cells of Y. See [Cells and Sub-arrays](https://help.dyalog.com/latest/Content/Language/Introduction/Variables/Cells%20and%20Subarrays.htm#CellsSubarrays).

This can also be expressed as the length of the leading axis or 1 if Y is a scalar. Tally is equivalent to the function {⍬⍴(⍴⍵),1}.
#### Examples
      ≢2 3 4⍴⍳10  
2  
      ≢2  
1  
      ≢⍬  
0
Note that ≢V is useful for returning the length of vector V as a scalar. (In contrast, ⍴V is a one-element vector.)

## Depth, tally `≡≢`[](https://xpqz.github.io/cultivations/Functions3.html#depth-tally "Permalink to this headline")

Monadic `≡B` gives the [depth](http://help.dyalog.com/latest/index.htm#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Depth.htm) of `B`, which is the amount of nesting. A simple scalar is 0, a vector is 1, a vector of vectors is 2, etc. If the amount of nesting is uneven throughout the array, the result will be negative, and indicate the maximum depth.

`≢B` is the [tally](http://help.dyalog.com/latest/index.htm#Language/Primitive%20Functions/Tally.htm) of `B`, i.e. how many major cells `B` has. For a scalar, that’s 1. For a vector, it is the number of elements, for a matrix it is the number of rows, for a 3D array it is the number of layers, and so on.

≡(1 2 (3 4 5 (6 7 8)))  ⍝ unevenly nested vector
≢1                      ⍝ scalars tally to 1
≢3 2⍴⍳6                 ⍝ matrix tally is the number of rows
