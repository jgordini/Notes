# UAB Wellness Scan (ongoing)

> **Purpose**: This document captures the results of bottom-up and
> top-down scan of wellness initiatives at UAB. The bottom-up scan is
> being conducted by UAB communicators across all academic and
> administrative units. The top-down scan is being conducted by members
> of the scan subcommittee of the President's Wellness Collaborative. In
> conducting these scans, our goal was report back to the overall
> President's Wellness Collaborative using the broad definitions of
> wellness as defined by the [[Okanagan
> Charter]{.underline}](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/53926/items/1.0132754).
> There was no weighting or filtering of results. If a program or
> resource could be considered an aspect of wellness, it is included.
> Our purpose is to scan and report -- not to judge or adjudicate.
>
> **Methodology**: The scan committee decided to provide a minimalistic
> structure to help scanners collect ongoing wellness programs and
> initiatives. We choose to use the categories of Overarching, Personal,
> Community, Society, and Natural Environment Wellness. While this is a
> judgment call, we used the following guidance to adjudicate between
> categories to place a program or initiative:

-   **Personal programs** are focused on the individual. Many
    HR/Benefit/individual empowerment, training, or educational programs
    are in this category.

-   **Community programs** are focused on the university or Birmingham
    area. In the broad definition of community wellness, educational
    outreach programs change the trajectory of lives and their
    associated wellness and thus are included here.

-   **Society programs** are focused on national or international
    programs or endeavors. Selected research centers were included as
    societal programs as they seek to improve the wellness of everyone.

-   **Natural Environment programs** are focused energy conservation,
    smart city, and climate change. We sought to include programs,
    policies, and training in the UAB Wellness Scan.

# **UAB Wellness Scan (ongoing)** {#uab-wellness-scan-ongoing}

**Purpose**: This document captures the results of bottom-up and
top-down scan of wellness initiatives at UAB. The bottom-up scan is
being conducted by UAB communicators across all academic and
administrative units. The top-down scan is being conducted by members of
the scan subcommittee of the President's Wellness Collaborative. In
conducting these scans, our goal was report back to the overall
President's Wellness Collaborative using the broad definitions of
wellness as defined by the [Okanagan
Charter](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/53926/items/1.0132754).
There was no weighting or filtering of results. If a program or resource
could be considered an aspect of wellness, it is included. Our purpose
is to scan and report -- not to judge or adjudicate.

**Methodology**: The scan committee decided to provide a minimalistic
structure to help scanners collect ongoing wellness programs and
initiatives. We choose to use the categories of Overarching, Personal,
Community, Society, and Natural Environment Wellness. While this is a
judgment call, we used the following guidance to adjudicate between
categories to place a program or initiative:

-   **Personal programs** are focused on the individual. Many
    HR/Benefit/individual empowerment, training, or educational programs
    are in this category.

-   **Community programs** are focused on the university or Birmingham
    area. In the broad definition of community wellness, educational
    outreach programs change the trajectory of lives and their
    associated wellness and thus are included here.

-   **Society programs** are focused on national or international
    programs or endeavors. Selected research centers were included as
    societal programs as they seek to improve the wellness of everyone.

-   **Natural Environment** **programs** are focused energy
    conservation, smart city, and climate change.

We sought to include programs, policies, and training in the UAB
Wellness Scan.

**Caveats**:

1.  This is an ongoing effort and this document will change over time.
    The committee believes we will reach a more refined state in April
    or May 2022.

2.  Most of this information is from UAB websites. Some wellness
    initiatives are going to require engagement with unit leaders after
    we have provided sufficient structures and examples so that it is
    easy for unit leaders to identify missed wellness initiatives in our
    scan.

# **UAB Wellness Scan (ongoing)** {#uab-wellness-scan-ongoing}

**Purpose**: This document captures the results of bottom-up and
top-down scan of wellness initiatives at UAB. The bottom-up scan is
being conducted by UAB communicators across all academic and
administrative units. The top-down scan is being conducted by members of
the scan subcommittee of the President's Wellness Collaborative. In
conducting these scans, our goal was report back to the overall
President's Wellness Collaborative using the broad definitions of
wellness as defined by the [Okanagan
Charter](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/53926/items/1.0132754).
There was no weighting or filtering of results. If a program or resource
could be considered an aspect of wellness, it is included. Our purpose
is to scan and report -- not to judge or adjudicate.

**Methodology**: The scan committee decided to provide a minimalistic
structure to help scanners collect ongoing wellness programs and
initiatives. We choose to use the categories of Overarching, Personal,
Community, Society, and Natural Environment Wellness. While this is a
judgment call, we used the following guidance to adjudicate between
categories to place a program or initiative:

-   **Personal programs** are focused on the individual. Many
    HR/Benefit/individual empowerment, training, or educational programs
    are in this category.

-   **Community programs** are focused on the university or Birmingham
    area. In the broad definition of community wellness, educational
    outreach programs change the trajectory of lives and their
    associated wellness and thus are included here.

-   **Society programs** are focused on national or international
    programs or endeavors. Selected research centers were included as
    societal programs as they seek to improve the wellness of everyone.

-   **Natural Environment** **programs** are focused energy
    conservation, smart city, and climate change.

We sought to include programs, policies, and training in the UAB
Wellness Scan.

**Caveats**:

1.  This is an ongoing effort and this document will change over time.
    The committee believes we will reach a more refined state in April
    or May 2022.

2.  Most of this information is from UAB websites. Some wellness
    initiatives are going to require engagement with unit leaders after
    we have provided sufficient structures and examples so that it is
    easy for unit leaders to identify missed wellness initiatives in our
    scan.

The original document lists a scholarship for underrepresented students
under Personal

Health and Wellbeing for Engineering. We actually have a bunch of
different diversity

scholarships, but I don't think scholarships make sense to list here, so
I recommend

deleting that entry.

 

In terms of activities not reflected here, Engineering is very involved
in the Grand Challenge,

but that is already listed under the President's office, so I think that
is covered.

 

Otherwise, Engineering does not have anything to add at that this time.

# **UAB Wellness Scan (ongoing)** {#uab-wellness-scan-ongoing}

**Purpose**: This document captures the results of bottom-up and
top-down scan of wellness initiatives at UAB. The bottom-up scan is
being conducted by UAB communicators across all academic and
administrative units. The top-down scan is being conducted by members of
the scan subcommittee of the President's Wellness Collaborative. In
conducting these scans, our goal was report back to the overall
President's Wellness Collaborative using the broad definitions of
wellness as defined by the [Okanagan
Charter](https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/53926/items/1.0132754).
There was no weighting or filtering of results. If a program or resource
could be considered an aspect of wellness, it is included. Our purpose
is to scan and report -- not to judge or adjudicate.

**Methodology**: The scan committee decided to provide a minimalistic
structure to help scanners collect ongoing wellness programs and
initiatives. We choose to use the categories of Overarching, Personal,
Community, Society, and Natural Environment Wellness. While this is a
judgment call, we used the following guidance to adjudicate between
categories to place a program or initiative:

-   **Personal programs** are focused on the individual. Many
    HR/Benefit/individual empowerment, training, or educational programs
    are in this category.

-   **Community programs** are focused on the university or Birmingham
    area. In the broad definition of community wellness, educational
    outreach programs change the trajectory of lives and their
    associated wellness and thus are included here.

-   **Society programs** are focused on national or international
    programs or endeavors. Selected research centers were included as
    societal programs as they seek to improve the wellness of everyone.

-   **Natural Environment** **programs** are focused energy
    conservation, smart city, and climate change.

We sought to include programs, policies, and training in the UAB
Wellness Scan.

**Caveats**:

1.  This is an ongoing effort and this document will change over time.
    The committee believes we will reach a more refined state in April
    or May 2022.

2.  Most of this information is from UAB websites. Some wellness
    initiatives are going to require engagement with unit leaders after
    we have provided sufficient structures and examples so that it is
    easy for unit leaders to identify missed wellness initiatives in our
    scan.
