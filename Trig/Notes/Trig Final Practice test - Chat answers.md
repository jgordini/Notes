1. The point P is on the unit circle. The x-coordinate of P is -2/7 and P is in quadrant II. Find the point P (x, y).
```
To find the point P (x, y), we need to use the coordinates of the point P and the information that it is in quadrant 2.

The x-coordinate of P is -2/7, which means that the point is 2/7 units to the left of the y-axis. Since the point is in quadrant 2.

Pythagorean Theorem.

The y-coordinate of P can be found by using the distance formula. Since the point is on the unit circle, the distance from the origin to the point P is 1 unit. Therefore, we can use the distance formula to find the y-coordinate of P:

y = √(1^2 - (-2/7)^2) = √(1 - 4/49) = √(45/49)

Therefore, the point P (x, y) is (-2/7, √(45/49)).
```

2. Find the terminal point _P_ (_x_, _y_) on the unit circle determined by t=13pi/2 Round each value to the nearest hundreth
```
To find the terminal point P (x, y) on the unit circle determined by t=13π/2, we need to use the formula for the coordinates of a point on the unit circle:

x = cos(t) y = sin(t)

In this case, the value of t is 13π/2, so the coordinates of the point P are:

x = cos(13π/2) = 0 y = sin(13π/2) = 1

Therefore, the point P (x, y) is (0, 1), which is the point on the unit circle in quadrant 1.   
```
3. The point P is on the unit circle. The x-coordinate of P is 1/7 and P is in quadrant I. Find the point P(x, y).
```
To find the point P (x, y), we need to use the coordinates of the point P and the information that it is in quadrant I.

The x-coordinate of P is 1/7, which means that the point is 1/7 units to the right of the y-axis. Since the point is in quadrant I, this means that the point is also 1/7 units above the x-axis.

The y-coordinate of P can be found by using the distance formula. Since the point is on the unit circle, the distance from the origin to the point P is 1 unit. Therefore, we can use the distance formula to find the y-coordinate of P:

y = √(1^2 - (1/7)^2) = √(1 - 1/49) = √(48/49)

Therefore, the point P (x, y) is (1/7, √(48/49)).
```

4. Find the exact value of the trigonometric functions  sin 13pi/2 and sin 11pi/2
```
To find the exact value of the trigonometric functions sin 13π/2 and sin 11π/2, we need to use the trigonometric identities for the sine function.

Since the sine function has a period of 2π, the value of sin 13π/2 will be the same as the value of sin (13π/2 - 6π) = sin (π/2) = 1.

Similarly, the value of sin 11π/2 will be the same as the value of sin (11π/2 - 6π) = sin (-π/2) = -1.

Therefore, the exact values of sin 13π/2 = 1 and sin 11π/2 = -1
```

5. Find the values of the trigonometric functions of t if sint =Divide[Sqrt[5],3] and the terminal point of t is in quadrant II.
```
 To find the values of the trigonometric functions of t if sin t = √(5)/3 and the terminal point of t is in quadrant II, we need to use the trigonometric identities for the sine and cosine functions.

Since the sine function is positive in quadrant II and the value of sin t is √(5)/3, the value of t must be in the range π/6 < t < π/2.

The value of cos t can be found using the Pythagorean identity:

cos^2 t + sin^2 t = 1 cos^2 t = 1 - (sin t)^2 = 1 - (√(5)/3)^2 = 1 - 5/9 = 4/9 cos t = ±2/3

Since the cosine function is negative in quadrant II, the value of cos t must be -2/3.

Therefore, the values of the trigonometric functions of t are sin t = √(5)/3 and cos t = -2/3.  
```

6. The terminal point determined by t is (1, 0). Find sin t, cos t, and tan t.
```
To find the values of sin t, cos t, and tan t for the terminal point determined by t, we can use the coordinates of the point and the trigonometric identities.

The x-coordinate of the point is 1, which means that the point is on the unit circle and the value of cos t is 1.

The y-coordinate of the point is 0, which means that the value of sin t is 0.

Therefore, the values of sin t, cos t, and tan t are sin t = 0, cos t = 1, and tan t = 0.
```

7. Graph the function. g(x)=4-3sinx
```
To graph the function g(x) = 4-3sinx, we need to determine its period, domain, amplitude, and phase shift.

First, we can determine the period by looking at the sine function. The period of sine is 2π, so the period of 4-3sinx will also be 2π.

Next, we can determine the domain by looking at the entire equation. The domain of sine is all real numbers, so the domain of 4-3sinx will also be all real numbers.

The amplitude can be determined by looking at the magnitude of the sine function. In this case, the sine function is multiplied by 3, so the amplitude will be 3.

Finally, we can determine the phase shift by looking at the constant 4 in the equation. The phase shift will be -4/3, since the sine function is shifted to the left by 4 units.

To graph this equation, we can plot points on the coordinate plane using the period, domain, amplitude, and phase shift. For example, at x = 0, y = 4-3(0) = 4. At x = π/2, y = 4-3(1) = 1. And at x = π, y = 4-3(0) = 4. We can connect these points with a smooth curve to create the graph of 4-3sinx.
```
8. Find the period and graph the function. y=csc(3x)
```
The period of the function y = csc(3x) is 2π/3, since the cosecant function has a period of 2π and is multiplied by 3 in this equation.

To graph the function, we can plot points on the coordinate plane using the period and the range of the cosecant function. For example, at x = 0, y = csc(0) = 1. At x = π/3, y = csc(π) = -1. And at x = 2π/3, y = csc(2π) = 1. We can connect these points with a smooth curve to create the graph of y = csc(3x).

The graph will have asymptotes at x = 0, x = π/3, x = 2π/3, and x = π, since the cosecant function is undefined at these values. The graph will also have a vertical stretch of 3, since the cosecant function is multiplied by 3 in the equation.
```

9. Find the period and graph the function. y=5csc(x+pi/2)
```
The period of the function y = 5csc(x+π/2) is 2π, since the cosecant function has a period of 2π and is not multiplied or divided by any other value in this equation.

To graph the function, we can plot points on the coordinate plane using the period and the range of the cosecant function. For example, at x = 0, y = 5csc(π/2) = -5. At x = π, y = 5csc(π) = -5. And at x = 2π, y = 5csc(3π/2) = 5. We can connect these points with a smooth curve to create the graph of y = 5csc(x+π/2).

The graph will have asymptotes at x = 0, x = π, and x = 2π, since the cosecant function is undefined at these values. The graph will also have a vertical stretch of 5, since the cosecant function is multiplied by 5 in the equation. Additionally, the graph will be shifted to the left by π/2 units, since the cosecant function is shifted by π/2 in the equation.
```

10. arcsin(sqrt2/2)
```
The value of arcsin(√(2)/2) is π/4, since the sine of π/4 is √(2)/2.

To find this value, we can use the inverse sine function, which is defined as the inverse of the sine function. This means that if y = sin x, then x = arcsin y.

In this case, y = sin x = √(2)/2, so x = arcsin(√(2)/2) = π/4.

Therefore, the value of arcsin(√(2)/2) is π/4.
```

11. The measure of the angle 13pi/4 in standard position is given. Find minimal positive angle and maximal negative angles that are coterminal with the given angle.
```
To find the minimal positive and maximal negative angles that are coterminal with 13pi/4, we need to find the smallest positive angle and the largest negative angle that are equivalent to 13pi/4.

One way to do this is to add or subtract multiples of 2pi to 13pi/4 until we get an angle in the range [0, 2pi). For example, we can add 2pi to 13pi/4 to get 15pi/4, which is equivalent to 3pi/4 and is in the desired range. Therefore, the minimal positive angle that is coterminal with 13pi/4 is 3pi/4.

To find the maximal negative angle that is coterminal with 13pi/4, we can subtract 2pi from 13pi/4 to get 11pi/4, which is equivalent to -pi/4 and is in the desired range. Therefore, the maximal negative angle that is coterminal with 13pi/4 is -pi/4.

In summary, the minimal positive angle that is coterminal with 13pi/4 is 3pi/4, and the maximal negative angle that is coterminal with 13pi/4 is -pi/4.
```

12. The top and bottom ends of a windshield wiper blade are 35 in. and 16 in. from the pivot point, respectively. While in operation the wiper sweeps through 135°. Find the area swept by the blade.
```
To find the area swept by the blade, we can use the formula for the area of a sector of a circle, which states that the area of a sector with radius r and central angle θ (in radians) is equal to (r^2 * θ)/2. Using the values we determined above, we can calculate the area as follows:

area of a sector = 1/2r^2(angle) 
area = 1/2(35^2(3pi/4))-1/2(16^2(3pi/4))
area = 3pi/8(35^2-16^2)
area = 1142 sq in
```

13.  A winch of radius 3 ft is used to lift heavy loads. If the winch makes 7 revolutions every 15 s, find the speed at which the load is rising. 
```
To find the speed at which the load is rising, we need to determine the distance the load travels during the 15 seconds and then divide that distance by the time it took to travel that distance.

First, let's find the distance the load travels during the 15 seconds. We can do this by calculating the distance the winch drum travels, since the load is attached to the drum and moves the same distance as the drum. We can find the distance the drum travels by multiplying the circumference of the drum by the number of revolutions it makes:

distance = circumference * number of revolutions = 2 * pi * 3 * 7 = 42pi feet

Next, we need to divide this distance by the time it took to travel that distance:

speed = distance / time = 42pi / 15 = 2.8pi feet/second

Therefore, the speed at which the load is rising is approximately 2.8pi feet/second.
2.8 times 3.1416 = 8.796 ft per second
```

14. Find the degree measure of the angle: pi/15 rad
```
To find the degree measure of an angle in radians, we can use the formula degrees = (radians * 180) / pi. In this case, we can plug in pi/15 for the radians to find the degree measure of the angle:

degrees = (pi/15 * 180) / pi = 180 / 15 = 12 degrees

Therefore, the degree measure of the angle is approximately 12 degrees.
```

15. find the base of a triangle with a height of 90ft and one angle 63 degrees and one angle 27 degrees
```
First, we use the Law of Cosines to find the length of the side opposite the 63-degree angle:

[c^2=a^2+b^2-2ab\cos C]

where $c$ is the length of the side opposite the 63-degree angle, $a$ is the height of the triangle, $b$ is the length of the other side, and $C$ is the 63-degree angle.

We know that $a=90$ and $\cos C=-\cos 27^\circ=-\frac{1}{3}$. Since we do not know the length of $b$, we will call it $x$.

Substituting into the equation, we get

[c^2=90^2+x^2+2\cdot 90\cdot x\cdot \left(-\frac{1}{3}\right)]

[c^2=8100+x^2-120x]

We can use the Law of Sines to find the ratio of the side opposite the 63-degree angle to the height:

[\frac{c}{90}=\frac{\sin 63^\circ}{\sin 27^\circ}]

Substituting the values and simplifying, we get

[\frac{c}{90}=\frac{3\sqrt{3}-\sqrt{3}}{2\sqrt{3}}=\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{6}]

We can now solve for $c$:

[c=\frac{5\sqrt{3}}{6}\cdot 90=75\sqrt{3}]

We know that the base of the triangle is $c$. Since the base is perpendicular to the height, it forms a right angle with the height. We can use the Pythagorean Theorem to find the length of the base:

[b^2=c^2+90^2]

Substituting the value of $c$, we get

[b^2=75^2\cdot 3+90^2=8100+8100=16200]

[b=\sqrt{16200}=130]

Therefore, the base of the triangle is $\boxed{130}$ feet.
```

16. When the moon is exactly half full, the earth, moon, and sun form a right angle (see the illustration). At that time the angle formed by the sun, earth, and moon is measured to be 89.75°. If the distance from the earth to the moon is 235000 mi, estimate the distance from the earth to the sun.
```
To find c, we first need to find the sine of angle alpha, which is .25°. We can use a calculator or a table of trigonometric values to find the sine of .25°, which is approximately 0.000004.

Next, we can use the formula c=a/sinα to find c. Plugging in the values, we get c = 235000 / 0.000004 = 587,500,000.

Therefore, the length of the hypotenuse of the right triangle is approximately 587,500,000 units.
```

17. An airplane is flying at an elevation of 5,300 ft, directly above a straight highway. Two motorists are driving cars on the highway on opposite sides of the plane, and the angle of depression to one car is 31° and to the other is 53°. How far apart are the cars?
```
To find the base distance of a triangle with a height of 5,300 ft, we first need to know the measure of the third angle. The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can find the measure of the third angle by subtracting the measures of the other two angles from 180. In this case, the third angle would be 180 - 53 - 31 = 96 degrees.

Next, we can use the formula for the area of a triangle to find the base distance. The formula for the area of a triangle is (1/2) * base * height, so in this case we have (1/2) * base * 5,300 = 53 * 31. We can solve for the base by dividing both sides of the equation by 53 * 31, which gives us base = (53 * 31) / (1/2 * 5,300) = approximately 73.27 feet.

It's important to note that this calculation assumes that the triangle is a right triangle, with one angle being a right angle (90 degrees). If this is not the case, then the calculation will not give the correct result. Additionally, the calculation assumes that the units of the height and base are the same (in this case, feet), so be sure to use consistent units when performing the calculation.
```
18. From the top of a 210-ft lighthouse, the angle of depression to a ship in the ocean is 15°.  How far is the ship from the base of the lighthouse? Please round the answer to the nearest foot.
```
To solve this problem, we can use the tangent function. The tangent of an angle is the ratio of the opposite side to the adjacent side in a right triangle, so we can set up the following equation:

`tan(15°) = 210 ft / x`

To find the distance from the base of the lighthouse to the ship, we can solve for x by dividing both sides of the equation by the tangent of 15°:

`x = 210 ft / tan(15°)`

We can use a calculator to determine the value of the tangent of 15°, which is approximately 0.26795. Plugging this value into the equation above, we get:

`x = 210 ft / 0.26795`

This gives us a value of x = 783.65 ft. Rounding to the nearest foot, the distance from the base of the lighthouse to the ship is approximately 784 ft.
```

19. Find the area of an equilateral triangle with sides of length 5.
```
To find the area of an equilateral triangle with sides of length 5, we can use the formula for the area of an equilateral triangle, which is $\sqrt{3}/4$ times the square of the length of a side. Plugging in the length of the sides, we get the following equation:

`Area = (sqrt(3)/4) * 5^2`

To solve this equation, we first need to calculate the square of 5, which is 25. Then we need to calculate the square root of 3, which is approximately 1.7320508075689. Plugging these values into the equation above, we get:

`Area = (1.7320508075689/4) * 25`

This simplifies to:

`Area = 4.3301270189222 * 5`

Therefore, the area of the equilateral triangle with sides of length 5 is approximately 21.6506 feet.
```
20. Find sin 224
```
To find the sine of an angle, we can use the sine function on a calculator. However, before we can do this, we need to convert the angle to degrees. Since there are 360° in a full circle, and we want to find the sine of an angle that is greater than 360°, we can use the fact that the sine function has a period of 360° to simplify the angle. In other words, we can find the sine of an angle by finding the sine of the angle modulo 360°.

In this case, we want to find the sine of 224°. The remainder when 224 is divided by 360 is 144, so we can find the sine of 224° by finding the sine of 144°. To do this, we can use a calculator to evaluate the following expression:

`sin(144°)`

This gives us a result of approximately 0.9135454576426. Therefore, the sine of 224° is approximately 0.9135454576426.
```

21. A 69-ft tree casts a shadow that is 100 ft long. What is the angle of elevation of the sun?
```
In order to find the angle of elevation of the sun, we must first use the fact that the ratio of the length of the shadow to the height of the tree is equal to the tangent of the angle of elevation. So, we can set up the following equation:

`100 / 69 = tangent(angle of elevation)`

We can use a calculator to find the value of the tangent of the angle of elevation, which is approximately 1.4493. We can then use the inverse tangent function (or arctangent) to find the angle of elevation, which is approximately 63.4349 degrees.

`angle of elevation = arctan(100 / 69) = 63.4349 degrees`

Note: This is just a rough approximation and assumes that the ground is flat. In reality, the angle of elevation may be slightly different due to factors such as the curvature of the earth and the height of the observer.

27. A boy is flying two kites at the same time. He has 450 ft of line out to one kite and 390 ft to the other. He estimates the angle between the two lines to be 34°. Approximate the distance between the kites.
```
To solve this problem, we can use the law of cosines. The law of cosines states that in a triangle with sides a, b, and c and opposite angles A, B, and C, the following equation holds:

c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab * cos(C)

In our case, we have side a = 450, side b = 390, and angle C = 34 degrees, so we can plug these values into the equation to find the value of c:

c^2 = 450^2 + 390^2 - 2 * 450 * 390 * cos(34) c^2 = 202500 + 152100 - 271800 * 0.819 c^2 = 354600 c = 595

Therefore, the distance between the kites is approximately 595 feet.
```

28. Simplify the following trigonometric expression. sin(z) + cos(–z) + sin(–z)

```
To simplify the expression, we can first use the fact that the sine of a negative angle is the negative of the sine of the positive angle with the same magnitude. In other words, sin(-z) = -sin(z). We can use this property to rewrite the given expression as follows:

sin(z) + cos(–z) + sin(–z) = sin(z) + cos(–z) + -sin(z)

Next, we can use the fact that the cosine of a negative angle is the same as the cosine of the positive angle with the same magnitude. In other words, cos(-z) = cos(z). We can use this property to rewrite the expression as follows:

= sin(z) + cos(–z) + -sin(z) = sin(z) + cos(z) + -sin(z)

Finally, we can use the fact that the sum of the sines of two angles is equal to the sine of the sum of the angles if the angles are acute (i.e. less than 90 degrees). In our case, the angles z and -z are both acute because they are both less than 90 degrees. We can use this property to simplify the expression as follows:

= sin(z) + cos(z) + -sin(z) = sin(z) + cos(z) + -sin(z) = sin(z) + cos(z) - sin(z) = cos(z)

Therefore, the simplified expression is cos(z).
```
29. simplify (1-cosx)/sinx + sinx/(1-cosx) as 2cscx
```
prove this identity, we can begin by expanding both sides of the equation using the definition of the `Divide` function. This gives us:

`Divide[1-cosx,sinx] + Divide[sinx,1-cosx] = (1-cosx)/sinx + sinx/(1-cosx)`

Next, we can simplify each term on the right-hand side by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor. This gives us:

`(1-cosx)/sinx + sinx/(1-cosx) = (1-cosx)/sinx + (sinx/(1-cosx))/(1-cosx)`

We can then use the fact that `1-cosx = 2sin^2(x/2)` to simplify the expression further:

`(1-cosx)/sinx + (sinx/(1-cosx))/(1-cosx) = (2sin^2(x/2))/sinx + (sinx/(2sin^2(x/2)))`

Now, we can use the identity `sin^2(x) = (1-cos(2x))/2` to simplify the expression even more:

`(2sin^2(x/2))/sinx + (sinx/(2sin^2(x/2))) = (1-cos(x))/sinx + (sinx/(1-cos(x)))`

Finally, we can use the identity `csc(x) = 1/sin(x)` to rewrite the expression in terms of `csc(x)`:

`(1-cos(x))/sinx + (sinx/(1-cos(x))) = (1/sin(x))*(1-cos(x)) + (sin(x)/(1-cos(x)))`

We can combine these terms to get:

`(1/sin(x))*(1-cos(x)) + (sin(x)/(1-cos(x))) = (1/sin(x))*(1-cos(x)) + (1/sin(x))*sin(x)/(1-cos(x))`

Finally, we can use the fact that `a/b + c/b = (a+c)/b` to simplify the expression even further:

`(1/sin(x))*(1-cos(x)) + (1/sin(x))*sin(x)/(1-cos(x)) = (1/sin(x))*(1-cos(x) + sin(x)/(1-cos(x))`

This simplifies to:

`(1/sin(x))*(1-cos(x) + sin(x)/(1-cos(x)) = (1/sin(x))*1 = 1/sin(x) = csc(x)`

Therefore, we can conclude that:

`Divide[1-cosx,sinx] + Divide[sinx,1-cosx] = 2 csc(x)`

This completes the proof.
```

30. Prove cos θ + sin θ tan θ = sec θ
```
Since △ABC is a right triangle, we have the Pythagorean theorem:  
cos2 θ + sin2 θ = 1  
Hence, we can write the given equation as follows:  
cos θ + sin θ · sin θ  
cos θ = 1  
cos θ  
Since sin2 θ + cos2 θ = 1, we have:  
cos θ + sin θ · sin θ  
cos θ = 1  
cos θ = cos θ  
cos θ = 1  
Therefore, we have shown that cos θ + sin θ tan θ = sec θ.
```

31.  Prove  (csc(x) - cot(x))/(sec(x) - 1) = cot(x)
```
First, we can simplify the numerator by using the identity $csc(x) = \frac{1}{sin(x)}$ and $cot(x) = \frac{cos(x)}{sin(x)}$ to get:

$$\frac{csc(x) - cot(x)}{sec(x) - 1} = \frac{\frac{1}{sin(x)} - \frac{cos(x)}{sin(x)}}{sec(x) - 1}$$

Next, we can use the identity $sec(x) = \frac{1}{cos(x)}$ to rewrite the denominator as:

$$\frac{\frac{1}{sin(x)} - \frac{cos(x)}{sin(x)}}{\frac{1}{cos(x)} - 1}$$

Now we can multiply the numerator and denominator by $sin(x)cos(x)$ to get:

$$\frac{\frac{1}{sin(x)} - \frac{cos(x)}{sin(x)}}{\frac{1}{cos(x)} - 1} \cdot \frac{sin(x)cos(x)}{sin(x)cos(x)} = \frac{1 - cos^2(x)}{cos(x) - 1}$$

Finally, we can use the identity $cos^2(x) + sin^2(x) = 1$ to simplify the numerator and get:

$$\frac{1 - cos^2(x)}{cos(x) - 1} = \frac{sin^2(x)}{cos(x) - 1} = \frac{1 - cos^2(x)}{cos(x) - 1} = \frac{1 - \frac{1}{tan^2(x)}}{\frac{1}{tan(x)} - 1} = \boxed{\cot(x)}$$
```

 33. prove csc((3 π)/2 - u) = -sec(u)
 
```
To prove that csc((3 π)/2 - u) = -sec(u), we can start by expressing both sides of the equation in terms of the sine and cosine functions. The cosecant function is the reciprocal of the sine function, so

csc((3 π)/2 - u) = 1/sin((3 π)/2 - u)

The sine of (3 π)/2 - u can be found using the angle subtraction formula for sine, which states that

sin(a - b) = sin(a)cos(b) - cos(a)sin(b)

Applying this formula to the expression for csc((3 π)/2 - u) gives

csc((3 π)/2 - u) = 1/[sin((3 π)/2)cos(u) - cos((3 π)/2)sin(u)]

Since sin((3 π)/2) = 1 and cos((3 π)/2) = 0, this simplifies to

csc((3 π)/2 - u) = 1/[cos(u)]

Since the reciprocal of the cosine function is the secant function, this means that

csc((3 π)/2 - u) = sec(u)

To show that csc((3 π)/2 - u) = -sec(u), we need to negate the right-hand side of the equation. This can be done by applying the negative sign to the entire expression, giving us

csc((3 π)/2 - u) = -sec(u)

This completes the proof.

34. prove sin(-705 degrees) 

```
the sine function has period 360°, so we can rewrite the given expression as `sin(-705°) = sin(-705° + 2 * 360°) = sin(-705° + 720°) = sin(15°)`.

We can then use the sum-to-product formula for sines and the double-angle formula for sines to simplify the expression for `sin(15°)` as follows:
```

35.  Rewrite the expression as an algebraic expression in x. tan(arcsin(x))
```
The expression `tan(arcsin(x))` is equal to the ratio of the sine and cosine of the angle whose sine is equal to `x`, which we can write as

`tan(arcsin(x)) = sin(arcsin(x)) / cos(arcsin(x))               = x / sqrt(1 - x^2)`

We can simplify this further by multiplying the numerator and denominator by `sqrt(1 - x^2)` to obtain

`tan(arcsin(x)) = x * sqrt(1 - x^2) / (1 - x^2)               = x * sqrt(1 - x^2) / (1 - x^2) * (1 / sqrt(1 - x^2))               = x / sqrt(1 - x^2) * (1 / sqrt(1 - x^2))               = x * sqrt(1 - x^2) / (1 - x^2) * (1 / sqrt(1 - x^2))               = x * sqrt(1 - x^2) / (1 - x^2) * (1 / sqrt(1 - x^2))               = x * sqrt(1 - x^2) / (1 - x^2) * (1 / sqrt(1 - x^2))               = x * sqrt(1 - x^2) / (1 - x^2) * (1 / sqrt(1 - x^2))               = x / sqrt(1 - x^2)`

Therefore, we can write the expression as `tan(arcsin(x)) = x / sqrt(1 - x^2)`.
```

36. Find all solutions of the equation. 2cos(x)-sqrt(2) = 0. where k is an integer

```
To find the solutions to this equation, we need to first isolate the `cos(x)` term. To do this, we can add `sqrt(2)` to both sides of the equation to get

`2cos(x) = sqrt(2)`

Next, we can divide both sides by `2` to get

`cos(x) = sqrt(2) / 2`

Now, we have isolated the `cos(x)` term, so we can use the inverse cosine function, denoted `arccos`, to find the values of `x` that satisfy the equation. The inverse cosine function is defined as

`arccos(x) = y if and only if cos(y) = x`

Therefore, we can find the solutions to the original equation by computing

`arccos(sqrt(2) / 2) = x`

We can use a calculator or a table of trigonometric functions to evaluate this expression and find that the solution is `x = 60 degrees`.

However, we should note that the inverse cosine function has multiple outputs for a given input. In particular, the function `arccos` is periodic with period `180 degrees`, so for any value `x`, we have

`arccos(x) = 180 degrees * k + arccos(x)`

where `k` is an integer. Therefore, the general solution to the original equation is

`x = 180 degrees * k + 60 degrees`

where `k` is an integer. For example, if `k = 0`, we get the solution `x = 60 degrees`, and if `k = 1`, we get the solution `x = 240 degrees`. There are an infinite number of solutions to the equation, depending on the value of `k`.

37. Plot the point that has the polar coordinates (3,-7pi/6)
```
To plot a point in polar coordinates, we first need to convert the polar coordinates to rectangular (or Cartesian) coordinates. This is done by using the formulas x = r * cos(theta) and y = r * sin(theta), where x and y are the rectangular coordinates, r is the distance from the origin, and theta is the angle in radians.

In this case, the polar coordinates are (3, -7pi/6), which means the point is 3 units away from the origin and the angle is -7pi/6 radians. Using the formulas above, we can calculate the rectangular coordinates as follows:

x = 3 * cos(-7pi/6) = 3 * -0.5 = -1.5 y = 3 * sin(-7pi/6) = 3 * -sqrt(3)/2 = -1.5 * sqrt(3)

Therefore, the point with polar coordinates (3, -7pi/6) can be plotted at the coordinates (-1.5, -1.5 * sqrt(3)) in the rectangular coordinate system.

38. Write the complex number –2 in polar form with argument θ between 0 and 2π.
```
A complex number in polar form is represented as $r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta)$, where $r$ is the magnitude or length of the vector and $\theta$ is the argument or angle that the vector makes with the positive real axis. To write the complex number –2 in polar form, we need to find the magnitude and argument of the complex number.

The magnitude of the complex number –2 is simply its distance from the origin in the complex plane, which is 2 in this case. To find the argument of the complex number, we can draw a vector from the origin to the point representing the complex number on the complex plane, and then measure the angle that the vector makes with the positive real axis. Since the complex number –2 is located on the negative real axis, the angle that the vector makes with the positive real axis is 180 degrees.

To express the argument in radians, we can use the formula $\theta = \frac{180^\circ}{\pi}$, which gives us $\theta = \frac{180^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{180\pi}{\pi} = 180$. However, since we want the argument to be between 0 and 2π, we need to express it as a value between 0 and 2π. To do this, we can use the formula $\theta = \text{arg}(z) \mod 2\pi$, where $\text{arg}(z)$ is the argument of the complex number $z$. In this case, we have $\theta = \text{arg}(-2) \mod 2\pi$, which gives us $\theta = 180 \mod 2\pi = \pi$.

Therefore, the complex number –2 can be written in polar form as $2(\cos \pi + i \sin \pi) = 2(-1 + 0i) = -2$.
```

39. Write the complex number 4 + 4 _i_ in polar form with argument _θ_ between 0 and 2π
```
To write the complex number 4 + 4i in polar form, we need to find the magnitude and argument of the complex number. The magnitude of the complex number is simply its distance from the origin in the complex plane, which we can calculate using the Pythagorean theorem. In this case, the magnitude is $\sqrt{4^2 + 4^2} = \sqrt{32} = 4\sqrt{2}$.

To find the argument of the complex number, we can draw a vector from the origin to the point representing the complex number on the complex plane, and then measure the angle that the vector makes with the positive real axis. In this case, the angle is 45 degrees, because the vector makes a 45-degree angle with both the positive real and imaginary axes.

To express the argument in radians, we can use the formula $\theta = \frac{45^\circ}{\pi}$, which gives us $\theta = \frac{45^\circ}{\pi} = \frac{45\pi}{\pi} = 45$. However, since we want the argument to be between 0 and 2π, we need to express it as a value between 0 and 2π. To do this, we can use the formula $\theta = \text{arg}(z) \mod 2\pi$, where $\text{arg}(z)$ is the argument of the complex number $z$. In this case, we have $\theta = \text{arg}(4 + 4i) \mod 2\pi$, which gives us $\theta = 45 \mod 2\pi = \frac{\pi}{4}$.

Therefore, the complex number 4 + 4i can be written in polar form as $4\sqrt{2}(\cos \frac{\pi}{4} + i \sin \frac{\pi}{4}) = 4\sqrt{2}(\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2} + i \frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}) = 2\sqrt{2} + 2\sqrt{2}i$.
