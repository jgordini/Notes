4. Describe the job duties that will be expected of you.

   1. Applying mathematical models to researcher data, analyze large and complex datasets to extract meaningful insights.

5. List at least 3 ways that you will use math in your field of work.

   1. **Statistical Analysis**: Data scientists often use statistical methods to interpret and analyze data. This involves applying techniques such as hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and variance analysis to understand trends, make predictions, and inform decision-making processes. For instance, regression analysis helps in understanding the relationship between different variables, which is crucial for predicting outcomes based on observed data.
   2. **Machine Learning and Algorithms**: Math is essential in developing and understanding machine learning algorithms. Algorithms, whether they are for supervised or unsupervised learning, are based on mathematical concepts like linear algebra, calculus, and probability theory. For example, linear algebra is used in the implementation of algorithms like Support Vector Machines (SVMs) and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), while calculus is important for understanding how algorithms are optimized during the learning process.
   3. **Data Processing and Optimization**: Data scientists use mathematical models and algorithms to process and analyze large datasets efficiently. Techniques from numerical analysis and optimization are applied to solve problems that involve large-scale data. This can include tasks like data cleaning, normalization, and transformation, as well as more complex operations like network analysis or optimization of resources.
